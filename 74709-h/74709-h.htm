<p><i>Academy</i>—‘We take up a book by Miss Arabella Kenealy confidently expecting
to be amused, and in her latest work we are not disappointed. The story is so
brightly written that our interest is never allowed to flag. The heroine, Lois
Clinton, is sweet and womanly.... The tale is told with spirit and vivacity,
and shows no little skill in its descriptive passages.’</p>

<p><i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>—‘A book to be read breathlessly from beginning to end. It
is decidedly original ... its vivid interest. The picture of the girl is admirably
drawn. The style is bright and easy.’</p>

<p><i>Literary World</i>—‘A really good story, original, well written and strong. A
really excellent and engaging story. The materials are rare, and, we must admit,
ideal ... can be read with interest and enjoyment.’</p>

<p><i>Daily Chronicle</i>—‘Miss Kenealy has original ideas, a nice faculty of literary
expression.... Her description of the old house where dwelt her strange
young heroine, is quite admirable.... There is a quaintness and an air of
romance about the whole story, which are very pleasant to note and to remember.’</p>

<p><i>Truth</i>—‘Its heroine is at once original and charming.’</p>

<p class="center"><i>This Book ran through Six Editions in the Six Shilling form.</i></p>

<p><i>Daily Chronicle</i>—‘It is a clever book, and well worth reading; it can outstrip
the ordinary novel by many knots per day (to pursue the metaphor), and it may
make one or two people think who are unaccustomed to that exercise. Miss
Kenealy has imagined an interesting character, and realised her vividly.’</p>

<p><i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>—‘In “Dr Janet of Harley Street,” Dr Arabella Kenealy
has shown that the art of writing lively fiction is not the least of her many accomplishments.
Moreover, she has achieved the rare distinction of producing a novel
which is didactic and not dull. Miss Kenealy has a quick sense of humour, and a
lively faculty of observation, and her style is vivid and effective.’</p>

<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo, cloth, 6s.</i> <span class="smcap">Fourth Edition.</span></p>

<p><i>Black and White</i>—‘Her latest novel has advanced her to the front rank of lady
novelists.’</p>

<p><i>The Daily Chronicle</i>—‘A clever story. The most powerful piece of work that
Miss Kenealy has done.’</p>

<p><i>The Pall Mall Gazette</i>—‘This powerful story ... brilliantly achieved.
Her style is, as always, graceful and easy, and her character sketches are excellent
and humorous.’</p>

<small>SHADOWED!</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Harry Goodall</span>, a young, tall and well-set-up
gentleman, was walking impatiently to and fro on the
south side of Trafalgar Square, as if he were awaiting
the arrival of someone who had agreed to meet him.
The fact was, he was in a hurry to get to Sydenham,
where he was about to try a scientific experiment,
and was momentarily expecting a cab conveying a
model apparatus which he was going to test. While he
was waiting, his attention was drawn to two men
who, in crossing the road, were nearly run over, and
who, as soon as they caught sight of Goodall, nudged
one another and whispered for a moment, and then
disappeared behind one of the lions. Almost immediately
the cab Goodall was expecting drew up with a
long, coffin-shaped box on the top, and, at the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
moment, the two men emerged from their hiding-place,
and passed Goodall as he stepped into the cab. He
noticed this action, and, for some undefined reason, he
merely instructed the coachman to drive over Westminster
Bridge. The cab bore him swiftly away, but
“More haste less speed,” for, as they went down the
incline on the Surrey side, the horse slipped and fell.
A crowd gathered, and Goodall alighted. As he did
so, he noticed a hansom pass him, in which were the
same two men he had observed watching him in
Trafalgar Square. Shortly afterwards, the cab horse
was got up on to his legs again and the journey to
Sydenham was proceeded with, after the coachman
had received definite orders as to his destination.</p>

<p>As he drove along, it occurred to Goodall that he
must be the object of these two men’s attention. The
question was, were they detectives who had mistaken
him for someone else, or were they spies put on by his
uncle, who was, he knew, most averse to the hobby of
his life, which, it may be said at once, was ballooning?
However, he dismissed the matter from his mind as
the cab drew up at the workmen’s entrance to the
Crystal Palace, where he deposited the box with the
officials and then drove on to the central entrance,
where he exchanged civilities with the general
manager, and with whom he chatted for a short time
in the transept as to what he proposed doing in the
way of experiments, and so on. Passing into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
building, and wending his way through the groups of
refreshment tables, although his mind was full of his
project, he could not help noticing a party of people
seated at one of the tables. It consisted of a young
lady and two gentleman, while another person, as if an
attendant on one of them, stood in the background.
The lady was remarkably pretty, and one of her companions
was an aristocratic-looking old gentleman—a
country squire in appearance—but the other, whose
face Mr Goodall had seen before, gave him a rude,
fixed stare, and, as Goodall drew nearer, he recognised
him as one of the two men who had passed him in the
hansom, whilst the man in the background was his
companion. Thinking that this third <i>rencontre</i> was,
perhaps, after all, merely a coincidence, Mr Goodall
passed on through the door of the tropical department,
and soon afterwards entered a square, glass-built room
of large dimensions, which is situated beneath the
lofty North Tower, and which had been placed at Mr
Goodall’s disposal to facilitate a series of aeronautical
experiments, but not in a public capacity, demonstrating
his own ideas on aeronautics, and which aimed
at rescuing ballooning from the imputation that its
pursuit, which had become valuable for military purposes,
must necessarily be attended with continual
risk, and with those frequent fatalities which have
cast a slur on its more recent practice.</p>

<p>In Mr Goodall’s laboratory, or workroom, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
preferred to call it, was a smart young fellow named
Trigger, who acted as his assistant, whilst two lady-like
women, Mrs Chain and her daughter, were giving
the finishing touches to a superb silk balloon, work
with which Goodall had entrusted them out of compassion,
being aware that they were in bad circumstances
through having been swindled by a fraudulent
financier, who had embezzled funds of theirs given
him to invest.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mrs Chain,” said Mr Goodall.
“Did you ever see a more glorious day? And you,
Miss Chain, you wish me success to-day, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, Mr Goodall. I was just saying to
Lucy”—with a nod over to a young woman, Tom
Trigger’s sweetheart,—“that you seem as fortunate as
the Queen with respect to weather.”</p>

<p>In addition to the silk balloon, at which they were
working there were model machines in the workroom,
together with a great mass of tackle, all appertaining
to the practice of ballooning. The special
contrivance that was to undergo a trial that day was
a cone-pointed aerostat of thirteen feet in length, by
four feet in central diameter, which Mr Goodall had
brought with him in the cab. The amateur’s idea
was to use it somewhat like a keel or centre-board
boat of novel shape, which was to be driven by a
screw propeller on the lake, so as to cause the air-ship,
while floating in its own element, some feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
above the aquatic contrivance, to deviate several
points from the straight course of the wind, as steering
by the aid of water, in Mr Goodall’s opinion,
could be more easily managed than by steering solely
in the air above.</p>

<p>Whilst this invention was being prepared for trial
in the lower grounds on the lake, the shadows of two
outside visitors were cast on the cotton screen which
hung all round the workroom on the inside. As
these persons came nearer to the front window, their
shadows became more distinct, and they represented
a tall man and a shorter person behind, but the
leading one was very inquisitive, peering about, trying
his level best to get a glimpse of what was going
inside. Lucy, whose quick eye was the first to detect
the intruder, drew Mr Goodall’s attention to
him, when the aeronaut requested them to keep quiet
while he had a good look at the profile of the man,
as if it struck him very forcibly that it was one of
the two who had been watching and following him in
London and in the palace.</p>

<p>The little man moved away, but his companion
remained looking through every nook and crevice to
see who was inside. Miss Chain, who felt an irrepressible
desire to catch a glimpse of the intruder,
took advantage of a hole in the screen to satisfy her
curiosity. She had no sooner looked than she
started back with a scream, and fell fainting into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
a chair. The spy, hearing the cry, vanished immediately.</p>

<p>Miss Chain looked pale and frightened, but, with
Lucy’s assistance, she soon recovered herself.</p>

<p>Trigger wanted to open the door and go after the
man, but his master stopped him.</p>

<p>“You had better keep quiet,” said Mr Goodall,
“as Miss Chain’s attack may be, after all, only the
result of close air and overwork. A walk round the
archery ground presently will do her all the good
in the world, and, meanwhile, we can go down to the
lake to try my air-ship.”</p>

<p>Lucy, although glad to see her friend’s recovery,
looked upon the whole thing as a joke, and remarked
as much, whereupon Mr Goodall, who overheard her,
agreed, and laughingly said,—</p>

<p>“A phantom figure has possibly appeared.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said Miss Chain; “it was no phantom
I saw, Mr Goodall, but the figure of one
who—”</p>

<p>“There now, don’t take on any more,” said Lucy,
as she held the smelling salts nearer to Miss Chain’s
face, and, giving her a significant nudge, silenced her.</p>

<p>“You will soon be all right,” said Mr Goodall,
as he prepared to leave with Trigger. “You must
take a holiday this afternoon and get some fresh
air.”</p>

<p>When, however, the aeronaut and his assistant had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
left, poor Miss Chain cast a scared look at the screen
and, turning to Lucy, said,—</p>

<p>“Holiday, indeed! This is the worst thing that
has happened since I left Boulogne. I will tell you
more of what I mean when we are in the open air.
If I could only meet him face to face, Lucy, instead
of only seeing his shadow!”</p>

<p>“No doubt you would let him have it hot,” replied
Lucy, in her honest, blunt way; “but, as it is only a
vision, you had better keep quiet until he does show
up, and then if he opens his mouth and has anything
to say worth hearing, I will chime in and help you.”</p>

<p>“Do you think, Lucy, that creature is prowling
about without a fixed object? He must have heard
that I am here. And wasn’t there another man with
him just before I fainted?”</p>

<p>“There, goodness me, Miss Chain, don’t carry on in
that way; let us go out and look at the flowers. Remember
that I shall soon have to leave you for my
new situation in the country, but I hope that you
will come and see me in Sussex. Tom says it is at a
fine park.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could go too, Lucy.”</p>

<p>“Who knows? The lady might want a companion
some day. Come along, you’ll soon be better.”</p>

<p>“Not if I am worried again in this way by a
would-be gentleman, who has now seen me working
for my daily bread through his dishonesty. But here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
comes my mother. I am so glad, Lucy, that she went
out before he appeared. Don’t say anything about
it to her at present.”</p>

<p>“Never fear, Miss Chain, for I begin to see what
you mean, though I didn’t at first, that you may have
really seen that man who tricked you and your
mother at Boulogne in the shameful way you told
me about.”</p>

<p>“Hush! Let us drop the subject for to-day.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>AN ACCIDENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Goodall</span> and Tom Trigger made their way down
to a sheltered shed near the cricket ground of the
Crystal Palace, with the air-ship, and they proceeded
to inflate it through a small gas-pipe, which was three-quarters
of an inch in diameter. This process occupied
an hour, so that they had ample time to talk
about Miss Chain’s fright and fit.</p>

<p>“What is your opinion of what happened just now
in the workroom?” asked Mr Goodall.</p>

<p>“Hardly know, sir, I’m sure. Where there’s smoke
there’s fire, and where there’s shadow there’s substance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, especially as a look through the peep-hole
confirmed Miss Chain’s suspicions, whatever they
were.”</p>

<p>“Do you think, sir, that he was looking after her?”</p>

<p>“To be candid, Trigger, I rather thought that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
fellow was looking after me, and wanted to know
where my balloons were located. I have come across
him three times before this morning.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, that seems odd.”</p>

<p>“I first saw him in Trafalgar Square, next he passed
me in a hansom when my cab broke down, and then
to my surprise he turned up in the palace, talking to
a young lady and a gentleman, and he had that same
little fellow with him whom we saw behind him outside
the room. I noticed, too, that the tall man gave
me an ugly look, as if he had some knowledge of what
my business here consisted of.”</p>

<p>“I think I have heard you say, sir, that your uncle
and your father both object to ballooning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they do. That reminds me, I have just heard
that my father has met with an accident on board one
of his own ships. The mishap is reported to have
occurred whilst he was on his way from Sydney to
Cape Town, and my uncle, a merchant in London, is
anxiously looking for further information. I must
see him as soon as possible, Trigger. But, as regards
these queer strangers who seem to be following me
about, I scarcely know what to think, for the big,
dark fellow is shadowing Miss Chain as well, it would
appear. I hope my uncle has not told him that I am
here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose he has, sir. For my part, I rather
think he is after the young lady.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“After the pretty girl who was with him in the
palace, do you mean?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I meant after Miss Chain, for he may
have known her before she came here. But these
shadows are wonderful things to terrify people,
though I don’t believe they’d send you into a fit,
Mr Goodall.”</p>

<p>“They might—into a fit of laughter, Tom. But, look
here, I want you to hurry on, for many reasons, my
first ascent, as all the arrangements are made, and I
did think of ascending this afternoon, but I have decided
to be satisfied with a trial of the air-ship instead,
and to baffle this spy. At the same time, the palace
directors are relying upon my keeping faith this week,
though no ascent has been announced, but the gas has
been ordered, so that we must proceed as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>“The air-ship is full now, sir. Shall I turn off the
gas?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I will lead the way to the lake and hold
her stem, while you keep abaft and carry the little
steam propeller.”</p>

<p>“I am quite ready, sir. It is just the day for this
sort of work.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I hope that all will go well and lead to
something successful. We must keep to this end of
the lake and get her under weigh before the wind
gets up, as a slight ripple is to be seen on the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
down where those boats are. I hope that we shall
not be interrupted by lookers-on.”</p>

<p>The aero-aquatic combination having been connected
by cords, Mr Goodall took up his position on
the windward bank, while Trigger went round to
the opposite side to receive the air-ship, and, as one
of the palace police was there in plain clothes, his
services were accepted to assist Trigger when she
crossed over, so nothing could have been more promising
to the experimentalists, who looked like boys
sailing their miniature cutters from side to side of
a pond.</p>

<p>But, during the third spin, when the ardent aeronaut
was intent on the working of his invention, two boats
approached so as to afford the rowers a closer view
of the attractive sight. In the first boat were two
youths, who evidently knew how to use their sculls,
but in the second boat a lady was standing up, eagerly
watching the air-ship, which was moving so prettily
over the water, whilst her companion, a fine-looking
man, was pulling almost savagely to get ahead, when
the two boats collided. For a moment the lady swayed
to and fro, trying to regain her balance, then there
was a splash and she had disappeared beneath the
water.</p>

<p>Mr Goodall, who was on the side of the lake where
the lady fell over, was expecting to see her reckless
rower spring in to her assistance, but he either lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
his head or lacked the courage to do so. Goodall
therefore, found himself instinctively divesting himself
of his coat, shoes and hat, when he dashed in
just in time to catch the lady by her hair as she
rose to the surface, and here he held her, whilst the
more spirited youths helped to take her into their
boat; but the gentleman, who looked as if he were
jealous of Mr Goodall’s prompt aid, rendered some
tardy assistance at last by holding on to the side
of the youths’ boat whilst the lady was being lifted
in. She was immediately taken to the bank, where
Trigger and the policeman came to the rescue. At
this juncture, her companion became demonstratively
active, while Trigger ran to the cricket ground refreshment
stall and brought back something to restore
the lady, who was not too far gone to perceive
who had rescued her in the nick of time; but her
feeble effort to express her gratitude to Mr Goodall
was checked by her now officious companion whose
arm encircled her waist, whilst he ignored the aeronaut
altogether, and seemed to take to himself the credit
of having saved her.</p>

<p>With a smile at this effrontery, Mr Goodall went
to see after his air-ship, which had got among the
trees, and Trigger went to fetch his master’s clothes,
which were on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the policeman advised that the lady
should be taken in a cab to the Thicket Hotel, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
was not far off in the Anerley Road, and there she
was seen to and provided with dry clothes by the
landlady.</p>

<p>When Trigger was alone with his master in the
workroom, he could not help expressing his indignation
at the “conceited snob,” who had never even
thanked Mr Goodall for his services.</p>

<p>“I only wish,” Tom said, “we had him here, and if
I wouldn’t pitch into him for his cowardly behaviour,
may I never ascend with you again, sir!”</p>

<p>“I admire your pluck, Trigger, but you forget that
he may have been here to take note of my movements.
You did not notice, perhaps, that he was
the spy, the shadow man, who accompanied the young
lady whom I saw in the palace to-day. In the
excitement of the moment, I did not at first identify
the party, but I can very well understand the fellow’s
feelings towards me; besides, I am sure that he is no
friend to me. Mind that you do not, for the present,
mention what has happened to Miss Chain or to
Lucy. When I have changed my clothes, I’ll come
back and look up the policeman to find out how the
lady is. Remember, not a word, Trigger.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir; I’m as good as if I were under
sealed orders, and I am not the man to break
faith.”</p>

<p>Presently the policeman knocked at the door and
informed Mr Goodall that the lady was getting on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
nicely, and that the gentleman had gone up to the
Palace Club room to meet the lady’s father, and to
inform him of what had taken place. A carriage
was then ordered to take the trio to catch a train
that was going south, but neither the lady nor the
gentleman mentioned where they were going to, or
whence they came.</p>

<p>After hearing these particulars, Mr Goodall, who
seemed to know the man’s face, asked him his name.</p>

<p>“My name, sir, is Warner.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I recollect you now perfectly. What is your
Christian name?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, it is Simon, sir; but I do not belong
to the detective department, though I am as sharp,
perhaps, as some of them that do.”</p>

<p>“I daresay, and I’ll get you to keep an eye on my
workroom if you will.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure, sir. I know that you have a lot
of valuable property here, and I told your assistant,
when I helped him at the lake, that I would look
round occasionally.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Warner. Now, tell me more about the
lady.”</p>

<p>“You saved her life, Mr Goodall, and not a moment
too soon, but her companion tried to make her believe,
after you left, that he rescued her. I couldn’t stand
it any longer, and, whilst the gent was out of the
way, I blurted out the plain truth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“And what did the lady say to your honest
candour, Warner?”</p>

<p>“She replied, ‘You know, policeman, and I know
that a strange gentleman in his shirt sleeves took
me out of the water, and I had seen that stranger once
before to-day in the palace, and should you see him
again, express the deepest gratitude to him from me,
and I shall hope to see you again, policeman, if you
will leave me your name.’”</p>

<p>“Well done, Simon! You’ll be a rising man some
day. I hope you left your name?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t, sir, for I heard the lady’s friend
coming before I could say much more.”</p>

<p>“That was a pity, Warner, though, personally, I do
not wish to be mixed up with that affair more than I
have been, as my social position and family connection
compel me to pursue my hobby in as quiet and
private a manner as possible.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I understood something of that sort from
Trigger, who told me not to open my mouth too wide
about his master’s doings. In my line we are careful
about that, Mr Goodall; but, hang me if I could
keep from popping in a word about you when I
found that the lady was being told all wrong as to
who saved her.”</p>

<p>“You are quite sure that you did not mention my
name?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, sir; the lady was hurried off and I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
suppose that we shall hear much more about the
affair, as people of that sort like to hush up accidents
that would drag their names into the newspapers.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, Warner, give me a look up soon
again. I should like to have another chat with you.”</p>

<p>“I know, sir, that the lady would have liked to
have heard more about the gentleman who rescued
her, as she asked me who you were and when you
were going to make another experiment. Of course
I said nothing on that subject.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Her friend ought to have saved her. I’ve
met him several times before to-day. I suppose you
don’t know who he is?”</p>

<p>“I do not, sir, but he looked as if your prompt
plunge made him feel ashamed of himself.”</p>

<p>“He has been hanging about here to catch sight of
Miss Chain or of me.”</p>

<p>“It’s my humble opinion, sir, that we shall see him
again before long, and that little man as well.”</p>

<p>“Look sharp after them then, Warner!”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best, sir, but I am not a trained detective
like Hawksworth whom you know.”</p>

<p>“Do I? I was not aware that I knew anyone of
that name.”</p>

<p>“I have seen him in your room, sir.”</p>

<p>“Have you? Then I didn’t know his calling.”</p>

<p>“He is that jolly, chatty person I have seen you
speaking to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“Do you mean that intelligent, pleasant sort of
man who used to interest himself so much in ballooning,
and who used to keep an eye on people outside
by looking through the peep-hole in the screen?”</p>

<p>“That’s the man I mean, sir. That is Jack Hawksworth,
who is said to be a London detective. He has
a case on here now, or I should say he is on the lookout
for two criminals from Australia.”</p>

<p>“Now you mention it, I have been surprised to see
him in two or three different ‘get-ups’ in the same
day; but really I took him to be someone connected
with the palace.”</p>

<p>“He has not been down long, sir, and I believe he
only comes out here for a change, as he expects to
spot his men among the fashionables inside. His make-up,
they say, is wonderful. But I hope you will not
let him know that I have mentioned who he is.”</p>

<p>“Oh that’s all right, Warner, but I shall certainly
not satisfy his inquiries or encourage his visits for
the future; but I shall always be glad to see you
here, as you are skilful and discreet.”</p>

<p>“I forgot to mention, Mr Goodall, that the young
lady alluded to the reckless way the dark gentleman
rowed their boat to look at your air-ship. She also
said he considered flying machines and flying men
much more useful than balloons.”</p>

<p>“They undoubtedly would be, Warner, if they
could be made to fly and navigate the air.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“I thought, sir, that men and air machines had
flown as high as the tower yonder.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe in anything of that kind,
Warner. Why, a fortune could be made if they could
cross and re-cross the North Tower.”</p>

<p>“Then, you don’t believe in directing balloons, sir,
or in flying?”</p>

<p>“I have already shown you this morning that
balloons, by the combined aid of air and water, can,
to some extent, be guided on the ocean, and I shall
some day try my plan on a larger scale, at sea,
perhaps.”</p>

<p>“I should like to assist in that work, Mr Goodall.”</p>

<p>“Well, strange things happen. You may, for all we
know, be able to render assistance in a trial of that
sort. It is my desire to show while I am here the
possibility of using balloons for one or two novel experiments,
and to show that they are still, if skilfully
handled, of more value than flying men, and
machines which cannot fly.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>MESSRS GOODALL BROTHERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a short time we will leave the amateur aeronaut,
in order to make the acquaintance of his uncle, Mr
William Goodall, who was a merchant and shipowner
in London.</p>

<p>His brother, Mr Henry Goodall, superintended the
Sydney branch of the firm, and was Harry Goodall’s
father.</p>

<p>Both uncle and father were very averse to ballooning,
and they were unanimous in desiring that Harry
should not only give up that pursuit and settle down
to a mercantile calling, but that he should conform to
their wishes as regards a young heiress, the only
daughter of Squire Dove of Wedwell Hall, Sussex,
who was a friend of theirs. The brothers, indeed,
both desired that Harry should make Miss Dove’s
acquaintance, with a view to future matrimony; but
he was obstinate, and could not be persuaded to fall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
in with their views, of which he had been duly
apprised.</p>

<p>About the time of the lake experiment, Mr William
Goodall was expecting a call from a Mr Falcon, who
had embarked at Sydney for Cape Town, with Henry
Goodall in his ship, the <i>Neptune</i>. On the voyage,
whilst a strong gale of wind was blowing, an accident
had happened to the owner, which was witnessed by
Mr Falcon and his servant. Captain Link, who commanded
the <i>Neptune</i> on this occasion, was not himself
an eye-witness of what took place, as he was
on the poop directing the crew. Mr Falcon was
indeed the only person who could give reliable information,
with the exception of the ship’s steward,—who
was lying seriously ill from injuries he received
by falling on his head.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, Mr Falcon came on in a
steamer from the Cape, in advance of the <i>Neptune</i>, in
order to give the London merchant full details of the
mishap, and to transact some financial business with
Squire Dove of Wedwell Hall, according to an arrangement
made with the Sydney merchant, who had
approved of Mr Falcon’s plans and desired that he
should negotiate with Squire Dove on his arrival in
England, though the financier was not empowered to
do so by any written document that he could produce,
but by an agreement, as he explained it, prior to the
merchant’s accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>One evening, while Mr William Goodall was dozing
in his armchair, Mr Falcon was ushered into his presence,
and so anxious was the merchant about his
brother’s fate, that he opened the conversation without
much ceremony; however, he did mention, as a
business-like prelude, that his brother Henry had told
him by letter that Mr Falcon was going to England
on financial matters of great importance, and that he
had kindly promised to try and persuade Harry to
abandon ballooning. It was moreover mentioned
that Mr Falcon would see Squire Dove, as the financier
specially wished to add his name and his contributions
to the new scheme which Mr Falcon had projected,
and which he wished to float in London. Mr
Goodall admitted, too, that his brother had spoken of
his intention to handsomely reward Mr Falcon by
testamentary disposition, if he were successful. Mr
Falcon was questioned, too, as to a recent will which
Henry Goodall was said to have made just before he
left Sydney,—but the financier was not communicative
on this subject.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Mr William Goodall, “tell me what
has happened to my brother?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir; it is a painful duty, but I will do
so to the best of my recollection. When I decided
upon leaving Sydney, accompanied by my servant,
an invaluable attendant, I had not the remotest idea
that your brother would go part of the way with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
us. It appears that he had, only a day or two before
the <i>Neptune</i> sailed, made up his mind to go as far
as Cape Town on urgent business, the nature of
which he did not mention to me. We had been
great friends for some time in Sydney, and my
servant, knowing his habits, was very useful to both
of us on board. Your brother was almost invariably
on deck, for he could not bear to be cooped up in his
cabin owing to an asthmatic affection. And when
a storm sprang up, without much warning, soon after
a rapid fall of the barometer, and before ample preparations
could be made to meet it, whilst the
<i>Neptune</i> began to pitch and roll heavily, I begged
of Mr Henry Goodall to go below; but it was
useless, he would remain. My servant and I were
both with him, when all hands were ordered to their
stations, and we began to ship heavy seas. Of course
Captain Link’s commands were promptly obeyed—men
were sent at once aloft to shorten sail, but, before
they had time to secure the upper sails, the ship was
once or twice almost on her beam ends. The fore-royal
and top-gallant sails were blown out of the
roping, and then the <i>Neptune</i> righted, but, as she
flew up to the wind, a fearfully heavy sea struck
her on the port bow, sweeping her decks and dashing
all three of us against the bulwarks. When the
ship cleared herself of this terrific sea, I looked
round, and, to my horror, your brother had disappeared.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
The steward, who had come on deck to
have a look round, immediately gave the alarm that
the owner was overboard, for he had caught sight of
a dark object with outstretched arms being swept
over the <i>Neptune’s</i> side. A moment afterwards, he
himself was, by another heavy sea, struck down the
companion ladder and stunned. The fury of the
gale, however, was such that no man could live in
such a sea. We laid to for more than an hour and
kept a most careful lookout, but no object could be
discerned, so that there remained no doubt, I am
sorry to say, that the owner had perished.”</p>

<p>“Excuse my emotion, Mr Falcon, the news is so
shocking; but tell me, did you or your servant see
my poor brother go overboard?”</p>

<p>“We could not possibly do so, sir, as we were
ourselves washed against the bulwarks, and narrowly
escaped being swept over too, but the steward saw
him go.”</p>

<p>“And what became of the steward?”</p>

<p>“God knows! I expect he is dead, sir. He was
hurt in the spine and head, so that when I left Cape
Town his life was despaired of.”</p>

<p>“Then there is no hope that my poor brother was
saved?”</p>

<p>“None whatever, I fear, for we saw nothing near
us, so far as the thick weather enabled us to perceive.
An hour or two later, when the moon rose and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
sea went down somewhat, we saw a dismasted
vessel in the distance, but he could not have reached
her.”</p>

<p>“I understand you to say that the weather had
been thick previously?”</p>

<p>“Very thick, but, as I have said, it cleared afterwards,
though no one on board had the slightest hope
that the owner could have survived the fearful seas
which raged at the time.”</p>

<p>At this point, Mr William Goodall was much moved
by Mr Falcon’s recital, then, for some moments, he
seemed to be absorbed in meditation, but, on regaining
his self-possession, he exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“I may have to proceed to Sydney, Mr Falcon,
but of course not before Captain Link’s arrival with
the <i>Neptune</i>. Now I must ask you <i>not</i> to move in
any financial matter connected with me, Squire Dove
and others, or on behalf of my poor brother, at
present, if you please, Mr Falcon, for I shall be most
anxious to hear Captain Link’s version of this
terrible affair.”</p>

<p>“I had your brother’s instructions to treat with
Squire Dove as soon after my arrival as possible, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; but now that he is dead, you will kindly,
I hope, defer to my wishes under the sad circumstances;
and, look here, Mr Falcon, I would not, should
you decide upon seeing my nephew, tell him what
has occurred.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“In that respect, sir, I will attend to your wishes,
but I must do something, known or unknown by
him, to prevent your nephew from seeking an introduction
to Miss Dove until he drops this frantic
ballooning, for I pledged myself to do so to your
late brother, Mr Goodall, before I left Sydney, and
I believe, sir, that ‘prevention is better than cure.’”</p>

<p>“I agree with you there, but you may not be aware
that my nephew is engaged in preparing for a series
of ascents from the Crystal Palace grounds. However,
I will not dictate to one of your clear discernment.”</p>

<p>“Don’t, please, Mr Goodall. I shall follow a plan
of which I think you will not disapprove—a plan
which may have a certain deterrent effect—but I shall
not put myself forward in such a way that he will
know me by name, nor shall I rashly check his movements.”</p>

<p>“No; I would not attempt to do anything that
would scare him or make him angry; but if you can
give him a distaste for his hobby, I presume you will
be carrying out my late brother’s wish—”</p>

<p>“And my own desire, sir; but I had better not argue
with him, perhaps, just now, though my eye will be
more frequently upon him than he may be aware of;
in fact, I have already seen him more than once, sir,
though he had no idea of it.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Then when Captain Link arrives, Mr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Falcon, would you like to meet him, and join us on
board near Gravesend?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be better for you to see Link alone,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think perhaps it would—and now will you
favour me with your address?”</p>

<p>“Allow me to hand you one of my cards, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I perceive your name is Filcher Falcon.”</p>

<p>“Oh—ah—I have given you the wrong card.”</p>

<p>“Eh? A relative’s, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t guess again, Mr Goodall, but here
is my own card and my hotel, sir; and if you will
let me have the other card back, I shall feel much
obliged.”</p>

<p>“Most certainly, Mr Falcon. And now, when do
you propose to visit the Doves?”</p>

<p>“I’ve already looked in at Wedwell Hall, Mr Goodall,
on my way up from Newhaven, as I had a packet to
deliver as early after landing as possible—that was
your brother’s express wish.”</p>

<p>“Was it really? But wouldn’t his awfully sudden
death check your ardour a little, and, to be candid, I
did not at all understand that you had seen the Doves.
Then, of course, you have seen Miss Edith Dove, the
squire’s only daughter?”</p>

<p>“I had that honour, sir, and found her a most
charming young lady.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, as you have seen the young lady that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
my poor brother wished his son to marry, you can
easily understand what a silly fellow my nephew is
not to avail himself of such a splendid opportunity.”</p>

<p>“Say rather of such a golden opportunity, sir, which
not one in a thousand could resist.”</p>

<p>“May I ask if Mrs Falcon accompanied you to this
country?”</p>

<p>“At present, sir, I am struggling on in single infelicity.”</p>

<p>“Well, to be sure! I was not aware of that. But
I perceive that you are of a facetious turn of mind.
However, I should advise you to mind how you deal
with my nephew, for, beneath a calm demeanour, he is
a resolute and touchy young fellow and an expert in
athletics,” said the old gentleman, who was really very
proud of his nephew. “But perhaps you know what
I mean, Mr Falcon?” he added.</p>

<p>“I don’t see much to fear, sir, but until your
nephew throws up ballooning, it would be perfect
madness for him to go down to Wedwell—to force
himself into Miss Dove’s society.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s your candid opinion, is it? Then all I
have to say further this evening, is to thank you for
this visit, and to remind you that we must meet again
shortly, if you have no objection.”</p>

<p>“Most readily, sir,” replied Mr Falcon, who took his
departure with an air of assurance, which left an impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
on the merchant’s mind that the colonial
financier was a highly objectionable character, who
was not a fit companion, much less adviser, for his
nephew—and certainly not for Squire Dove’s rich
and lovely daughter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>AN APPEAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Falcon’s</span> stirring details of the storm and of
the loss of Henry Goodall, left no room for doubt in
his brother’s mind that he had perished; and as the
financier, with more haste than discretion, had visited
the Doves and had met with a reception which was
warmer than the merchant was prepared to hear of,
it became advisable that he should send for his nephew
to beg of him to forego the allurements of ballooning
and submit himself forthwith to Miss Dove’s fascinations,
which had proved captivating even to the
colonial man of figures. However, Mr Goodall did
not at present propose to tell his nephew of his
father’s death.</p>

<p>The situation, judging from Mr Falcon’s disclosures
as to his admiration of Miss Dove, was hourly becoming
more critical, so that, on the arrival of the
amateur aeronaut, his uncle, with ill-disguised earnestness,
said,—</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, Harry, especially as urgent affairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
almost demand a meeting between us. Now tell me
what you have been doing? I hear that you have
been pottering about at the Crystal Palace with your
balloons, and associating with all sorts of people, instead
of being in the city with me, or visiting the Doves,
whose acquaintance you seem reluctant to make. I
am informed that your poor father—”</p>

<p>“Surely nothing serious has happened to him,
uncle?”</p>

<p>“I am not saying that, Harry, but I can tell you
that your father has met with an accident, and
that he was very anxious about you before he left
Sydney. He has sent on a Mr Falcon to see us, and
I am expecting Captain Link’s return shortly, when
I shall hear more precise news. Now, why not go
down at once to Wedwell Hall, in compliance with
your father’s wish and my own? I am amazed at
your shortsightedness and lack of curiosity in not
wishing to see and know a wealthy and excellent
young lady, endowed with many good qualities, and
who will become the owner some day of a magnificent
property, which you absolutely turn up your nose at.”</p>

<p>“Are you referring to Miss Dove, uncle?”</p>

<p>“You know I am; and if you fail to win her, someone
else will. Some vulgar millionaire will carry her
off while you are messing about in the clouds. I’ve
no patience with you!”</p>

<p>“Do stop, uncle, for I am inclined to remain for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the present just as I am. You cannot make a lover
of science into a fortune hunter. If fate had already
thrown me into the society of Miss Dove, I might,
or might not, have fallen in love with her. As it is,
I cannot withdraw from what I have in hand, nor,
to be candid, can I become a merchant’s clerk as a
means to an end.”</p>

<p>“Harry Goodall, I am shocked at your folly and
want of worldly wisdom. I admire your courage in
saying what you mean, and I have not a word to
say against your general good conduct and exemption
from the prevailing vices of the day, but your
persistence in this hallucination, for I can call it
nothing else, is most aggravating.”</p>

<p>“In what other respect, uncle?”</p>

<p>“Why, in mixing yourself up with questionable
associates, instead of moving more among people in
your own class of life.”</p>

<p>“There must be good among all classes, uncle, employers
and employed. People in my service, whether
men or women, have as high characters, probably, as
many who are above them in social position,” replied
the young man, with spirit. “Another point I will
venture to mention, uncle. I am too young to think
of settling down in life just yet.”</p>

<p>“You are not too young to have feminine associates
at the Crystal Palace, so I am told,” said his uncle,
turning round sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“I employ respectable needlewomen. No harm will
happen to them or to me at the Crystal Palace,
uncle.”</p>

<p>“I trust not, but I think you would be better engaged
by seeking lady-like society. However, I have
done what I could for you, and so has your—your
father, but your late indifference to our advice and
wishes is most worrying.”</p>

<p>“You forget, uncle, that I am not actually declining
to comply with your requests, so far as a visit
to the Doves goes, but I cannot do so at present.”</p>

<p>“Then I decline to say any more to you, beyond
this,—Take care, Harry Goodall, that you are not
cut off with a bare pittance. Your future prospects
depend upon your giving up your hobby, to begin
with. Whilst you continue a balloonatic, if I may use
a strong term, you will never be welcome at Wedwell.”</p>

<p>“I fail to see why, uncle.”</p>

<p>“Well, more fool you. That is all I have to say,
beyond this one reminder. I happen to know that
if you persist in not seeking Miss Dove’s hand, she
will soon be wooed, and very likely won, while you are
thinking about it. Then it will be too late, my boy,
and as to myself, I may have to leave England, perhaps
very soon; but your—your considerate father, before
he left Sydney, commissioned a friend to seek you
out and advise you to turn your attention to matters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
of business, and not to wilfully neglect Wedwell
Hall.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had Mr Goodall concluded what he was
saying, when a servant announced the arrival of the
“Ship Photographer.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know such a person,” replied the merchant,
“but perhaps you won’t mind seeing him, Harry?
At anyrate, show him up,” said Mr Goodall to the
servant.</p>

<p>“Which ship of mine have you photographed,
pray?” said the merchant to the man as he entered.</p>

<p>“Mr Goodall’s air-ship, sir.”</p>

<p>“Air-ship? That must be a vessel belonging to
my nephew?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The aeronaut here interposed, indignantly asking
by what right the man had gained admittance?</p>

<p>“Stay, stay, Harry,” cried the merchant; “he may
have something worth showing—something nautical,
perhaps?”</p>

<p>“Not altogether nautical, sir, but aeronautical,”
replied the photographer, apologetically.</p>

<p>“Then your errand is connected with my nephew,
and not with me?”</p>

<p>“Precisely, sir. I have hurried over from Sydenham
to show my first proofs of the ‘Rescue of the
Lady on the Lake.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“The rescue of the lady on the lake!” exclaimed
the merchant, with surprise.</p>

<p>“I protest, uncle, against this liberty and intrusion,”
said Harry. “I have had no notice that such a
subject was to be published.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the photographer, “do permit me, with
the most respectful deference, to explain that I was
taking views around the lake at the Crystal Palace
when you rescued that young lady from a watery
grave.”</p>

<p>“What business had you—” began Harry.</p>

<p>“Go on, photographer,” cried the merchant. “My
nephew seems to want to hide a praiseworthy act.
Let <i>me</i> see these proofs that you have brought.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ay—yes. I daresay they have an interest and
value of their own, but, without my glasses, I cannot
very well decipher the different figures. I must
study them a little, for I fancy I know one face.
You can leave these with me while you go below and
get some refreshment. I will ring the bell.”</p>

<p>“All I want, gentlemen, is your authority to
publish them.”</p>

<p>“On no account whatever,” said Harry, emphatically.</p>

<p>“I certainly agree with my nephew there,” added
the merchant.</p>

<p>“James,” said Mr Goodall to the servant who came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
in answer to the bell, “see that some refreshment is
sent up into the dining-room for this gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Wait one minute, Mr Photographer, while I take
another glance at your photos. Yes, Harry, there
you are, as plain as a pike-staff, in the water, lifting
up a lady, who looks more dead than alive, into a
boat. She has golden hair—dear, dear—and some
distance from her is a man. Surely I know that face.
Who is he, photographer?”</p>

<p>“He was said to be the lady’s intended, sir.”</p>

<p>“The deuce he was; he doesn’t look as if he were
worthy of her. I’m glad to see my nephew occupies
the post of honour.”</p>

<p>“It was a splendid act on the part of Mr Harry
Goodall, but the gent who is holding down the boat
to balance it whilst the lady is being lifted in, doesn’t
show up to great advantage.”</p>

<p>“You don’t happen to know his name?” again asked
Mr Goodall.</p>

<p>“No, sir; I wish I did, for several people have asked
me, as he has been cutting rather a queer figure at
the Crystal Palace lately, gentlemen, which you
might have heard about?”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Mr Goodall, with a fixed look at the
photographer, “you go down and have some refreshment
whilst I have a chat with my nephew.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged, I’m sure, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“You, Harry, must buy the negative of this affair,
and so prevent anything approaching to publicity; and
if you attach no value to these photos, I do. There
is one for you and I will keep the other, and here’s
some extra cash to square the artist with, but don’t
lose sight of him until you reach Sydenham, and
make the best arrangement you can; that being
done, do, my dear Harry, bring your travels in the
air to a close. I am not without hope that you will
yet make your mark in the world; in fact, you have
done so already. If you are pledged to make these
ascents, do so, dear boy, and then do something more
congenial to my taste, for I will not hide from you
that the accident to your father may prove a turning
point to the fortunes of our firm, and that is why I
wish to impress on you the great issues which may
follow your decision as to giving up ballooning and
seeking an alliance with Miss Dove.”</p>

<p>“When will this messenger from the pater come
to see me, uncle?”</p>

<p>“I cannot answer that question off-hand. He may
have been to the Palace without your knowing it; but
be guarded, Harry; he may not be a well-wisher to
you, after all.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the photo of the downcast man in
the boat is like Mr Falcon?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say for certain until I have studied the
photo more closely. There is some resemblance to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
the Sydney financier; at the same time, his figure is
something like our friend Captain Link’s, though his
expression of face is not so noble. I am rather
puzzled to know what his movements have been down
at Wedwell Hall. He has been to see the Doves on
some monetary affairs, and I should have been glad
to hear that you had been there as well. However,
it would be of little use, I feel sure, for you to
go there until you cut ballooning and join us in
the City.”</p>

<p>“I will think seriously of what you have said,
uncle, but I will make no promises.”</p>

<p>“Better not, Harry, if you would be likely to
break them. I want performances not promises,
and I have faith in you yet; that is, if you do not
drift into the extreme flightiness of the days in
which we live.”</p>

<p>“My own efforts, uncle, will not be in the form of
flight; but they may tend to expose the extravagances
of those who pretend that they can steer and
fly.”</p>

<p>“And what then are <i>you</i> going to do with
balloons?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know at present, uncle, but I hope to
show that balloons and an air-ship can be made to do
much more useful work than they are supposed to be
capable of performing.”</p>

<p>“Well, Harry, if in that negative style you can do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the least good, I wish you success, but I strongly recommend
you to let aeronautics alone, and to seek
my friend Squire Dove and his daughter. That will
be a more profitable pastime, I should say.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>SCHEMING!</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry Goodall</span> returned to his rooms on Sydenham
Hill, having travelled with the ship photographer,
whose productions had worked such a marvellous
change in Uncle Goodall.</p>

<p>A monetary settlement was speedily arrived at the
same evening, when a lively chat ensued, in which
the aeronaut agreed with the photographer as to
the gentleman on the lake being known to Mr
Goodall, who advised his nephew, after the dispute
at his residence, to pull off his ascents quickly. However,
the cheery conclusion of the aeronaut’s interview
caused him to sleep soundly and to be up in
good time the next morning to meet Tom Trigger,
who had taken the opportunity of his master’s absence
to go down with his Lucy to her new situation in
Sussex, after which outing, Tom brought back such
agreeable recollections of his trip, that Harry Goodall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
had to listen to what he had seen, and how the gamekeeper,
Bennet, had given him a turn at rabbit
shooting with a wonderful killing gun, which Trigger
was supposed to have handled with surprising dexterity.
He ended his story by saying that Lucy’s
last words to him were that he should be kind to
Miss Chain, who had been so cruelly imposed upon
by the man whose shadow on the screen she had
positively identified, and which Harry Goodall began
himself to infer was no other than a correct representation
of the mysterious Mr Falcon.</p>

<p>“But hold on, Tom,” cried his master, as his assistant
was proceeding with what he had seen and done;
“we shall have to finish your trip as we walk through
the Palace. I am very glad to hear that Lucy has
found such a nice situation, and as to Miss Chain’s
tormentor, you and I may settle the reckoning with
him some day perhaps, but I must remind you that
we have not a moment to spare, for, weather permitting,
an ascent must positively take place to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said Trigger; “and may I ask
how you got on with your uncle, sir?”</p>

<p>“The finish was better than the start, Tom. I
held my ground and stood to my guns during a hotly-contested
action on both sides, when a lucky turn was
given to the affair by the arrival of a photographer
from this establishment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; he showed me a capital photo. When I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
told him where you were, then he handed me one, sir,
which I gave to Lucy before she left here.”</p>

<p>“Be sure you tell her to destroy it, Tom, or not to
show it.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir, next time I see her.”</p>

<p>“I have suppressed them, Tom, as they might
expose just what I want to keep secret—namely, the
rescue of that lady.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think, sir, that one I gave to Lucy will
do much harm in her care, as she did not look at it
much; besides, she doesn’t know about the lake affair.”</p>

<p>“Good! We must now confine ourselves, Trigger,
to the necessary preparations for the morning. I
wish those two parachutes to be seen to and the
triangular frames for our model balloons, which
will prove a novelty.”</p>

<p>“I suppose, sir, we shall want the small silk balloon
for the signalling experiment?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you must see that they are all in readiness,
as I do not intend to follow on the old lines, even
with pilot balloons and parachutes. I will show,
if possible, another and more instructive way of
employing them than has hitherto been adopted.
Balloons and parachutes as well can be applied, you
know, Trigger, to better uses than they have been, as
my respected instructor has impressed upon me, and
he suggested also the <i>modus operandi</i> which I am
about to try.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“And I have no doubt they will succeed, sir. I
was going to ask, too, whether Messrs Brock had
not better see about your torpedoes and aerial shells
which you intend using?”</p>

<p>“They are already made, Trigger; but you can
let them know that they will be wanted to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Do you expect any of the military aeronauts
here, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I have not invited anyone. What I
undertake will be to show what has been left untouched
by war-balloonists, although I admit that
some of our military aeronauts are very clever and
are likely to figure creditably in actual warfare.
But of late, almost anybody is supposed to be
qualified for public ballooning, so long as he is what
is termed a break-neck fellow, and this qualification,
without other equally important ones, has brought
about such a long list of fatalities.”</p>

<p>“Everybody ought to know, sir, that successful
aeronauts are born, not made.”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite so; but here comes Warner. I must have
a few words with him in private, to ascertain if he
has any tidings of the spy, or of this great detective,
who has made our acquaintance without our knowing
who he was.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Hawksworth, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the very man, and Warner tells me
he is an expert in his line; but, if I am not very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
much deceived, Warner would accomplish quite as
much if he were promoted, and without so much
flourish of trumpets.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next day, the gorgeous balloon was brought
out betimes, though the ascent was not to take place
until the afternoon, but Mr Goodall wished to have
everything ready, so that the inflation could begin
before the dinner hour. The supply of gas was
known to be abundant, and a special main of large
dimensions was found beneath a slight slope, where
a roped circle was staked off to keep the ordinary
visitors at a suitable distance. A telegram had been
despatched to Mr Magnus Ohren, C.E., at the Lower
Sydenham Gas Works, and to Mr C. Gandon, the
engineer, to say that their inspector would be able
to turn on at 11.30 a.m. to the minute, and by that
time the first stream of gas was seen to raise the
flat silk, so that in less than half an hour a dome of
resplendent alternate segments of amber and crimson
gores elicited the admiration of many spectators. In
fact, there were already present, as regular daily
visitors to the Palace, rather more than the amateur
aeronaut cared about seeing, as he knew that they
would increase in numbers as the day went on,
for he dreaded anything approaching to a Bank
Holiday crowd.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Whilst the filling of the giant machine was going
on, Mr Falcon and his servant, Croft, stealthily entered
the turnstile of the North Tower, to quietly discuss
their past undertakings and future plans, well knowing
that at such an early hour they would, in all
probability, be alone on the balcony, having at the
same time a good view of all that was going on. It
was in this secluded spot that they drifted into a
retrospect of their previous doings, but naturally
their remarks were made in such a strain that no
third person could make head or tail of what they
were alluding to, although their ambiguity and
references might have attracted the attention of
Simon Warner, or of Hawksworth, had either of
them been within earshot of their observations.
However, as it happened, they were undisturbed for
more than twenty minutes and chatted freely together,
as the new lift at that time had not been
attached to the tower.</p>

<p>“What a magnificent prospect we have, Croft!”
exclaimed Falcon.</p>

<p>“It is that, sir, for we are ‘monarchs of all we
survey;’ at least, we shall be so eventually, I hope.”</p>

<p>“How so, Eben? I shorten your Christian name
of Ebenezer for prudential reasons.”</p>

<p>“I tumble to that, without objecting. What I
mean, Mr Falcon, is this, You wish, if not entirely, to
remove, at anyrate, to disable the amateur skyscraper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
yonder, as well as his balloon and his
assistant.”</p>

<p>“Just so, but who would have thought, Eben, that
a man playing the menial <i>rôle</i> you do would rise
above the level of gaol-birds, and talk as you can
when you like!”</p>

<p>“You needn’t taunt me with that; you know I was
well brought up, and but for our adventures—”</p>

<p>“Hold on! I thought I heard footsteps. Take a
look round, Eben, while I pose as an artist taking
sketches, from a lofty standpoint, of the aeronautic
scene.”</p>

<p>“What you say is all very fine, Mr F., but time is
money. Let us come to the point.”</p>

<p>“Very well then, here goes. On our left is the
balloon, looking as if it could be easily destroyed. An
idea flashes upon my mind that I can manage that
much at the descent, Eben.”</p>

<p>“Exactly; if you can manage to be there, Mr F.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here, Eben, the wind, don’t you see, is
blowing down to Gravesend, and, as I want to look
round Tilbury way, to find out when a certain ship
enters the Thames, I shall presently move in that
direction to watch what comes in, and also what
comes down that way from aloft; for I may as well
tell you, that as Goodall served me out by his
masterly rescue of that lady, I mean to give him a
Roland for an Oliver by spoiling his beauty, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
he cannot present himself at Wedwell. You follow me,
Eben, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I do, and will gladly consent to do as you propose.”</p>

<p>“That’s settled then; I need say no more on that
head.”</p>

<p>“But supposing that you do mar and cripple the
hobbyist and his hobby, what is your special object
for taking on such a risky performance?”</p>

<p>“Why, you short-sighted man, to have the heiress,
Miss D., all to myself, of course. I don’t want, between
ourselves, such a man as Harry Goodall to even
show his face at Wedwell Park—either as a young
merchant or in any other capacity; for we must have
two strings to our bow, in case our work on board the
<i>Neptune</i> fails to pay. We did our stroke of business
on the other side of the world, and the owner of
the <i>Neptune</i> is—”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Mr F.; let’s have no more reminders of
that sort, if you please. But, by-the-bye, how about
the will?”</p>

<p>“Not proven, at present, Eben; but didn’t I
manage that finely, and the life assurances in Sydney
as well. They, you remember, preceded the starting
of my financial scheme, which the squire is nibbling
at, and I will give him something else to nibble at,—namely,
a novel mode of flight.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, nibbling is all very well in its way, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
so is flying, but will the squire bolt the bait as you
are preparing it?”</p>

<p>“I think so, Eben, but you must hear the rest of my
plan. Now listen, on the left, well under us, is the
balloon, and on our right, almost directly beneath us,
is Goodall’s workroom, through the top of which we
can see everything, as there is no screen there—”</p>

<p>“Ah! now I begin to grasp what you wish to do.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“Why, to drop a shell down there, and—”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort, Eben. Wrong again, my boy.
All I want is this, You see that door below, leading
into the engine-house, near the foundation of the
glass-room?”</p>

<p>“Yes; what of that?”</p>

<p>“Well, just inside that engine-house there used to
be, and most likely is now, a disused back staircase
that leads to the glass-room. I now propose that you
should just explore there, and if the Chains are thereabout,
or Goodall or Tom T., you can hold off—any
way you will, if you once gain access, during the
dinner hour, so as to grope your way about and
leave your marks, for, as you know, I formerly had
some financial business with the Chains, and don’t
want to see much more of them. But mind what you
are about. Don’t be rash, Eben. I only want this to
be a little voyage of discovery.”</p>

<p>“You can consider that done, Mr F. I see now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
that I know what your little game is; but what else
am I to do?”</p>

<p>“You must first creep and then go ahead afterwards,
when I tell you to do so. The first part of my
plan of campaign is this,—The Chains must be shifted,
but not removed, mind that—you know what I mean—neither
dynamite nor bloodshed, but milder measures.”</p>

<p>“Such as you adopted—”</p>

<p>“Halt, man, halt. In the name of common sense,
what were you going to say?”</p>

<p>“Not much more I can tell you, guv’nor. The fact
is, we must cut it short and get to work. Just lend
me your opera glass please.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Why to see what I can make of that fellow talking
to Mr G. near the blessed balloon. Does he look
anything like Jack Hawksworth?”</p>

<p>“What, that muff who was expected in New South
Wales! I shouldn’t fear him, Eben, but I can see
Warner drawing this way; he is the one to avoid.”</p>

<p>“Then we’d better make a move.”</p>

<p>“Agreed, Eben; but half way down the steps we
had quite as well wheel round behind the shaft, so as
to give Mr W. the go by, in case he is looking about
and has seen us up here already.”</p>

<p>“One more word before we separate, Mr F. Whom
am I to have if you carry off the heiress?”</p>

<p>“You shall have that smart girl, Lucy, and a pub,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
close to Wedwell, with a handsome retiring allowance,
and, if you get into Goodall’s workroom, mind you
collar that manuscript of a ‘New Flying Machine,’
which is thought to be all rubbish—it may be useful
to us—as well as other tit-bits.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>During the progress of this lofty chat, Mr Harry
Goodall and Tom Trigger were still busy in letting
up the net-work, so that the new balloon rapidly developed,
and it was the opinion of everyone present
that so symmetrical a balloon had not been seen at
the palace for many years previously.</p>

<p>After some little time had elapsed, Miss Chain and
her mother rather impulsively left the workroom.
Soon after they had done so, a slight disturbance took
place close to the North Tower, near to which Miss
Chain and her mother were sauntering. Here a cry
was raised that a thief was in custody. There were two
or three policemen on duty near the balloon, Warner
being one of them, and now Warner was seen to be
bringing someone to the enclosure. He was a diminutive
man, though stiffly built, and had been seen coming
out of the engine-house, from which there was
access by a disused back staircase to Mr Goodall’s room,
where, of course, the prisoner had no business to be.</p>

<p>Tom Trigger, who about this time went into the
workroom for the parachutes, noticed that the inner
door had been forced open and left ajar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Warner’s clothes showed that there must have been
a tussle with his prisoner before he was brought to
the aeronaut, who said to him,—</p>

<p>“What have you been doing, my man, and where
do you come from?”</p>

<p>“My name is Eben, sir. I came with my master
from Sussex, and I was looking about for him—he
came to see the balloon, but I expect he has left for
Tilbury, as he had to go that way this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it, is it,” said Harry Goodall, who did
not think much of his offence. “Do you think you
need detain him?” he added, turning to Warner.</p>

<p>“I must do that, sir. He will have to go before
our inspector and the general manager, as he was
inside the company’s private premises. Besides, I
have reason to know he was in your room, too,
Mr Goodall.”</p>

<p>“Someone has been there,” said Trigger, who had
returned. “The inside door was open, a thing we’ve
never seen before.”</p>

<p>In reply to a question as to the state of Warner’s
clothes, the policeman said,—</p>

<p>“He is a downright Pocket Hercules, Mr Goodall—he
floored me by his wonderful strength. I had been
following him from the tower, where he had been
for some time with a big, swell-looking chap, whom I
have seen before, sir, though to-day he was got up in
quite a different suit. They had been looking down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
from the balcony on your balloon store, and they
came down together—the tall customer left, but this
man went inside your workroom, I saw him there,
after which he came out through the engine-house.”</p>

<p>Trigger then explained that he had seen them
dodging about earlier in the morning.</p>

<p>“I thought they looked like two of the party at the
lake, sir.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort,” cried the prisoner. “My
master is a rich gentleman, and we came up by the
Brighton line.”</p>

<p>“You must get to the bottom of this elsewhere,”
said Mr Goodall.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad, sir,” said Warner, “if you could
spare Trigger for a short time to state what he saw.”</p>

<p>“If anybody swears he saw me inside the room,”
cried the intruder, “he will be a confounded—”</p>

<p>“Hush, my man, I insist upon it, you will only aggravate
your case,” said Harry Goodall, “and now that I
get a closer look at your face, didn’t I see you and a
tall, dark man a day or two since in Trafalgar Square?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it must have been someone else, sir.”</p>

<p>“I am sure it was not—however,” said Mr Goodall,
turning to Warner, “he can’t stay here any longer.
Remove him.”</p>

<p>Whilst Miss Chain and her mother were walking
round, keeping within call of the aeronaut in case
they were wanted, they observed a figure which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
seemed familiar to them pass by as he hurried down
the grounds. He had on spectacles and a profusion
of sandy-looking hair, which they took to be a wig,
for he closely resembled the “shadow man” in his
gait and walk. And when a reversible-looking coat
flew open, as he hastily sped along, Mrs Chain exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Look at that cable-laid watch chain, dear! How
very like your father’s!”</p>

<p>“I do believe it is,” said Miss Chain, as the man
hurried onwards. “Surely he is Filcher who robbed
us in Boulogne, anyway he is the ‘spy’—the one
who has been tormenting us here.”</p>

<p>During the time that Trigger and Warner were
absent at the police station, the amateur aeronaut
had a few hasty words with Hawksworth, the so-called
detective, who had deigned to listen to a part
of the altercation, at a distance, between Warner and
his prisoner. Hawksworth appeared to have been
highly amused at the feeble attempt to find out
something against this little fellow, who had not, he
thought, from what little he had heard, done anything
worth noticing, beyond mistaking his way
while leaving the tower. This self-sufficient officer
was of opinion that the paltry evidence elicited by
Warner amounted to very little—there was no proof
of his guilt.</p>

<p>“I really,” replied the aeronaut, “have no time or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
mind to enter just now upon a discussion as to
detective theories. Warner, whose intelligence I am
ready to support on a more suitable occasion, has
taken this man in the act of having committed a
trespass, and he is acting not upon ‘vague clues or
roundabout rumours,’ but on stubborn facts. I
believe that Warner knows perfectly well what he is
about, and that the prisoner knows more about this
tall confederate than you do probably.”</p>

<p>“Most likely, Mr Goodall,” replied Hawksworth,
“for I merely caught a portion of what was said;
you mentioned something about a second tall man,
sir?”</p>

<p>“I cannot spare time to enlighten you any further,
Mr Hawksworth.”</p>

<p>“But this silly, card-sharping looking lad merely
said,” whispered the tall detective derisively, “that he
came from Sussex—had he hailed from the other side
of the world, sir, I should have opened my own
eyes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard that you are expecting two
clients from Australia; but we had better stop chatting,
there are listeners near us, Mr Hawksworth.”</p>

<p>“You are right, sir, and I am wrong in interfering,
perhaps. Kindly excuse me for having blundered.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid <i>you have blundered</i>,” cried Simon
Warner, “if you think that little man is guileless,
for he looked at you as if he knew you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“I am perfectly ignorant as to who he is, or what
he is doing here!” exclaimed the detective.</p>

<p>“More’s the pity,” cried Warner, who then placed
Croft, the Pocket Hercules, under proper care.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>AERONAUTICS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Harry Goodall had finished his conversation
with Hawksworth, he became very busy with the
help of the gas men and the gardeners. The lower
net-lines had been fixed to the hoop and the car, and
then, when the balloon stood proudly erect, it presented
a most magnificent specimen of the aeronautic
art. Directly Trigger returned, and the filling had
been completed, Mr Goodall began to inflate some
small balloons, which were designed to provide an
object lesson of some interest, besides showing what
course the large balloon would take when set free.</p>

<p>It happened that on this occasion, which was considered
a special and select affair, several of the
directors and their friends were present, besides men
of scientific knowledge, among whom was Mr Arthur
Deck, of Cambridge, who has made so many aerial
trips from a pure love and desire to encourage the
advancement of ballooning. The last-named gentleman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
as well as the directors, declared that they had
never seen more interesting miniature balloons than
those which were to precede the great ascent. There
were only three of them on each frame, but they were
of varied colours, having, as Mr Deck thought, rather
a political signification, for they had each a crowned
head and other devices on the centre belt, which, as
the aeronaut pointed out, were symbolical of the
Triple Alliance and of Union and Strength.</p>

<p>The three balloons were attached to the corners of
a triangular frame of wood, which was well balanced
by three lines connected to a central weight hanging
beneath the frame.</p>

<p>Mr Goodall, in an unpretentious manner, went on
to say that he would next show them another set of
balloons. Three more of blue, primrose and green,
and they would also be fixed fast to another triangular
frame, but the devices on them would at
once show that they represented the United Kingdom.
Shortly afterwards, whilst casting them free into
space, the aeronaut remarked,—</p>

<p>“We must keep an eye on them, for I cannot
guarantee that they will remain united.”</p>

<p>This remark produced fresh curiosity.</p>

<p>However, they did hold together for a time, and
by so doing, attained a great elevation, but at their
culminating point a noise was heard and smoke was
seen under the lovely-looking emerald balloon, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
suddenly became disunited, much to the disturbance
of the balance and power of the two firm and secure
balloons. It was true, as a spectator said, that the
green one shot up like a rocket, but equally true was
it that she came down soon afterwards like a stick,
in a very shaky and disorganised state, while the two
staunch balloons remained fast friends and still held
their own, notwithstanding the separation of the green
balloon.</p>

<p>“And this illustration will show you,” said the
aeronaut, “what may happen when—”</p>

<p>“Home Rule is passed,” cried a wiseacre close by.</p>

<p>However, the illustrations gave satisfaction, and
produced a lively cheer without causing any ill-feeling,
so that Tom Trigger was called upon next to
bring forth the two parachutes, which gave rise to
some sensational expectations, especially on the part
of a bystander, who looked like a provincial balloonist,
and who exclaimed, with a depreciatory laugh,—</p>

<p>“Oh! they are going to do a drop!”</p>

<p>“Are they?” said Trigger; “it will be with something
hot then if they do.”</p>

<p>“What a pity,” remarked one of the directors, <i>sotto
voce</i>; “that will spoil all.”</p>

<p>The parachutes, however, were attached to the netting
of the large balloon—one on each side. Then
Mr Brock, the pyrotechnist, came forward with his
assistants and produced two hoops, on which a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
of bombshells were fixed, and these petards gave rise
to singular apprehensions, but the aeronaut explained
as did the firework maker, that they would not prove
risky according to the way in which Mr Goodall intended
to employ them, as they could not explode
until they and the parachutes were lowered a certain
distance from the balloon, and even then a second
precautionary measure would have to be resorted to
before any explosion could take place. They were
simply designed to illustrate the application of parachutes
for warlike purposes, and were not intended
for bringing down acrobatic balloonists in safety.</p>

<p>This lucid and unlooked-for explanation proved so
far satisfactory, that the amateur aeronaut and his
assistant took their places in the car, when the after
arrangements were so carefully made that the liberation
of the balloon was not attended by so much
risk as the uninitiated expected. The ascent was
grand in the extreme, and when the first parachute
was detached, and it immediately spread out, all fear
was lost in admiration, particularly when the first
shell dropped about 200 feet and exploded with
the sound of a twelve-pounder; then followed another
shell, which burst at about 500 feet lower
down, and after that a succession of discharges took
place, illustrative of the manner in which naval
or military forces could be harassed through the
instrumentality of parachutes and bombs in conjunction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
with balloons, either with or without the
personal aid of practical men in the car. And Mr
Goodall further demonstrated, by the use of a
second parachute, how the line of bombardment
could be kept up, and how a number of comparatively
small balloons could thus sustain a
properly organised aerial attack, without any far-fetched
pretensions of introducing navigable machines
of foreign types, which would not act as designed
perhaps. But, with those proposed, it would only
be necessary to take up a suitable position on the
windward side of a hostile force to apply with
advantage such up-to-date contrivances which have
not as yet been turned to an available account in
the way set forth in these pages, for it is indisputable
that “The Powers that be” are too often
looking abroad for new lights and men with unpractical
schemes, while they ignore experienced
air-travellers at home, who could show them a
more excellent method of using balloons and parachutes,
even without waiting for navigable machines,
which would admittedly facilitate such operations in
mid-air if they could be depended upon to act in
the way they have been promised to do by sanguine
inventors. It must not be forgotten, however, that
military aeronauts, in the pursuit of their speciality,
could not rely upon grand expectations during the
tug of war. At such a time, in an emergency,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
England would have to provide the right men in
the right place, and to build only such contrivances
as had been thoroughly tested.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When Harry Goodall’s balloon lost the weight of
the parachutes and their appendages, it rose to a
considerable elevation, exceeding 7000 feet from the
earth, and here he was compelled to lessen his
altitude, as the drift of the upper current was
straight for the mouth of the river; but as he was
not more than three miles in a direct line from
the Crystal Palace, he determined at this distance
to try his old preceptor’s idea of long-distance signalling,
which he proceeded to do in the following way.</p>

<p>He had with him a smaller balloon which was
not very much more than half inflated with air,
effected by means of a fan. He had informed his
friend, Mr Deck, before starting, that if he lowered
this from a reel, which was fixed across the hoop
to four times the length of the balloon and car, the
signal would mean a distance of 250 feet, a second
indication on the scale would imply 500 feet, and
these relative heights would enable the spectators
to form some idea of what the barometrical height
really was; as the first signal, indicative of 250 feet,
would be nearly equal to a quarter of an inch less
pressure, and the 500 feet signal of the inverted air
balloon would imply nearly half an inch of reduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
pressure of air near the barometer. Thus this long-distance
signalling, which the writer of these remarks
first introduced at the Crystal Palace in the
year 1880, would enable the spectators to form an
approximate estimate of the height attained by the
balloon, though previously no such intimation had
ever been given from the explorers to those who
were watching their ascent from below.</p>

<p>Another useful plan was adopted by the amateur
aeronaut as he left the palace grounds. Upon being
asked by a director present, if he would give the
word to “let go,” so that all the men might do so at
the same moment, he replied,—</p>

<p>“Certainly not. My plan is to detach the balloon
at a favourable moment by this instrument which
acts instantaneously as a liberator. It is the system
adopted by the colleague of Mr James Glaisher, F.R.S.,
in the scientific ascents made over thirty years ago,
and which the famous meteorologist so much approved
of.”</p>

<p>Whilst Harry Goodall and his assistant were
actively engaged up aloft, they had not much time
to survey the surrounding country, although the
counties of Surrey, Kent, Essex and Middlesex were
very beautifully stretched out in a map-like form
beneath them, for their course had to be narrowly
watched owing to their proximity to Gravesend Long
Reach and towards the Nore Lightship. Besides, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
was not the aeronaut’s desire to make a prolonged
trip, as, for one reason, he felt anxious about his
property in the workroom, and for another he
wanted to ascertain more as to what the man Eben
had stolen, and whether he had been set free after
Tom Trigger left the palace, or whether he was
locked up for the night, for it was quite evident that
his assistant had formed a very unfavourable opinion
of him.</p>

<p>When the aeronaut found that, by a somewhat
different undercurrent, his balloon was getting near
to Northfleet Marsh, and that they were sinking
fast, it became necessary to watch the course of a
large, full-rigged vessel which was being towed up
to one of the docks, and just as they were skimming
over the ship, and Harry Goodall was wondering why
the crew did not cheer, he suddenly drew in his
head from looking over the car as if he had been
shot, and said,—</p>

<p>“I have made a discovery, Trigger; we are right
over the <i>Neptune</i>, my father’s ship from Sydney.
See, there stands Captain Link with his cap in
his hand, and there, too, on the poop, is my Uncle
Goodall with his head down, apparently reading a
letter.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps someone is dead on board, sir,” observed
Trigger, with a serious look, just as they became
enveloped in the black smoke of the tug, so that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
saw no more of the vessel until they were over the
sea-wall on the Essex banks of the river.</p>

<p>“My uncle told me,” said Harry Goodall, “that
he was expecting the arrival of Captain Link, but
I am awfully sorry to have passed right over the
<i>Neptune</i>, as it looks like sheer defiance, knowing his
dislike to ballooning. No wonder that my uncle
held down his head, and that the crew were as silent
as the grave.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice the flag, sir, if it was at half-mast;
but I sha’n’t look back, as they say it is unlucky.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t do it, Tom; besides, can’t you see that
the grapnel is near the ground. We may as well pull
up on this Essex marsh so as to get close to the
railway station over there, for I feel as if some
disaster has taken place, or as if something were
going to happen somehow. But tell me, Trigger,
what is that glittering in your side pocket?”</p>

<p>“Only my revolver, sir. Things looked so queer this
morning that I thought we ought to be prepared for
squalls, and if you don’t mind, sir, I’ll pop some
cartridges in the chambers, as there is no fear now
of any bumping. Your presentiment just reminded
me of it; anyhow there is no harm in being ready for
any rough customers.”</p>

<p>By-and-by they saw that people were running in
the course of the balloon.</p>

<p>“Sing out, Tom,” said Mr Goodall, “and tell that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
fellow who is spearing eels to mind the trail of the
grapnel—there he stands close to that person with
spectacles.”</p>

<p>“Spectacles, sir? Oh, yes, I see him; they’re standing
clear now.”</p>

<p>“All right, Tom, the grapnel is fast. I’ll let off gas
as quickly as possible, and, as there are several men
coming up, suppose you jump out; I’ve crippled her
sufficiently for you to do so with safety.”</p>

<p>“But mind you keep an eye, sir, on that party
with spectacles. Don’t you see who he is like?”</p>

<p>“All right, Tom; I’ve no time to notice resemblances
just now, but I’ll keep an eye on the fellow,
anyway.”</p>

<p>The eel-catcher was taken into Trigger’s confidence,
with a promise of reward if he stuck to him on one
side of the balloon, by pulling down the netting to
drive out the gas, while Mr Goodall and another
lot of men were drawing down on the other side.
Whilst the men were doing this, Mr Goodall held on
to the valve line to more quickly let out the gas, but
as he did so he crouched down behind the car, so that
the man with spectacles did not see him. In the
meantime Trigger had placed the crown valve on the
shoulders of two men to admit of the gas escaping
more readily, and then went to the eel-spearer to
give fresh instructions. Now, whilst everybody was
gazing intently at the balloon, the man with spectacles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
went a little way off, took off his glasses,
turned his coat which was a reversible one, and then
sauntered slowly back. When Mr Goodall, who was
still crouched down, noticed that his coat was quite
another colour, and that, in fact, the fellow looked
like another person, he became still more watchful of
his movements. The man then went towards the
crown of the balloon as it lay on the ground, and
when the silk was not more than a few feet above
the grass, the aeronaut saw the fellow strike a match
under the pretence of lighting a cigarette, and then
throw it, all ablaze, over the valve. Immediately a
long lambent flame shot up to a height of several
feet, when Trigger sang out to his master, but Mr
Goodall had, directly he saw the match lighted, with
great presence of mind, let go the valve line, when
the shutters of the valve closed with a resonant flap;
thus the flame was fortunately extinguished. Had
this step not been taken with the quickness of
thought, the entire silk would have been destroyed,
and most likely Mr Goodall would have been burnt
and other lives endangered.</p>

<p>Tom Trigger immediately flew towards the valve,
followed by the fisherman and Mr Goodall, but fortunately
no harm had been done, beyond a singeing
to the wooden framework. Had it not been held up,
however, the silk would have been fired, but Mr
Goodall’s prompt release of the cord brought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
two shutters so close to the frame that the explosion
was prevented in the very nick of time.</p>

<p>“Where is that spectacled chap?” asked the eel-catcher.
“He told me an hour ago that he was
looking for a balloon which would come this way.”</p>

<p>“There he goes!” cried Mr Goodall, who knew
him by his altered appearance.</p>

<p>“He is making for the station,” cried the fisherman,
“to catch that train coming in from Tilbury!”</p>

<p>“Let us go after him,” cried Trigger, who started
with his master and the eel-spearer in pursuit. The
man, however, kept well ahead, and Tom became so
exasperated at the thought of his escape that he
pulled out his pistol and let fly one after another each
barrel, holding it well up to allow for distance.</p>

<p>“That is the spy, the shadow man,” cried Tom to
his master. “I hope he is hit, sir.”</p>

<p>The result was uncertain, however, as he got into
the station and just caught the train, so that when
his pursuers came up they ascertained that he had to
be pushed into a carriage because he seemed to be
lame.</p>

<p>Thus foiled, the aeronauts returned to their work,
and engaged a conveyance for the balloon, which was
packed into the car and taken to the station, to go by
the next train to Fenchurch Street.</p>

<p>On their way back to Sydenham they saw nothing
whatever of the incendiary, who, they felt sure, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
Eben’s master, and the same person who had been seen
that day on the palace tower in disguise.</p>

<p>While in the train, Mr Goodall said to Trigger,—</p>

<p>“There is no doubt, Tom, but that I am beset by a
deadly enemy who is trying to injure me, but what
for I can’t imagine.”</p>

<p>“Jealousy, sir, depend upon it.”</p>

<p>“Of whom, or of what, Tom?”</p>

<p>“For your having saved that lady, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but he must be actuated by something
stronger than that, Trigger. From what my uncle
said, he must be a person from Australia, who is said
to have been in some way connected with my father
in business matters. And now I think of it, that
reminds me of a word or two that Hawksworth let
drop while you were in the building with Warner.”</p>

<p>“There is no knowing, sir, what this spy fellow is
up to, but we shall find out before long, I’ll be
bound.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, Tom, I shall never rest or give up
ballooning, until we do cross his path once
more.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear you say so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am curious to know what has gone from
the workroom—you recollect, Trigger, there were
papers there about flying, which I have not
thoroughly read yet; still, I should be sorry to
lose them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“Do you refer to Professor Scudder’s writings,
Mr Goodall?”</p>

<p>“Yes; though I daresay they are of an impracticable
kind; at the same time, I should
not like to find that they are in the hands of
our enemies.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>FINANCE AND FINESSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> may have been gathered, Mr Falcon’s actions in
first watching the movements of Harry Goodall and
of Miss Chain at the Crystal Palace, and then of
going to Wedwell to see Doctor Peters, were not so
much actuated by a desire to give the former a
distaste for ballooning, as to keep them away from
Wedwell Hall, where the financier had been manœuvring
to entrap Squire Dove, and at the same time
to lay siege to the affections of his daughter. This
kind of premeditated conduct was not in accordance
with the terms of Mr Falcon’s mission, undertaken
by him before he left Sydney—quite the reverse,
indeed.</p>

<p>And whether the financier was irritated by the
rising popularity of the amateur aeronaut at the
Crystal Palace, and retaliated by advancing himself
where Harry Goodall declined to step in, or whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
Falcon was prompted by a preconceived idea of trying
to get a large slice of the squire’s capital and
entire possession of his daughter, the reader will be
fully competent to judge.</p>

<p>If it be assumed that the financier set out on his
enterprise with the idea of <i>not</i> bringing Henry
Goodall’s son and Miss Dove together, but rather
of stepping in himself to seek the fair lady’s hand
and fortune, then, indeed, Mr Falcon’s eccentric conduct
at the Crystal Palace and on the Essex marshes,
is explained.</p>

<p>It would seem that at first Mr William Goodall was
inclined to believe in him, while he gave such a pathetic
account of the death of his brother Henry; but
when that was ended, his flippant and ironical remarks
caused the merchant to mistrust him. Squire
Dove, on the other hand, was attracted by Mr
Falcon’s monetary proposals, which were sufficiently
business-like to be accepted; but it is needless to
enter into details concerning them, as they may be
supposed to have been ostensibly sound, otherwise
the squire would not have caught at them so readily
as he did by advancing a large sum in cash, and also
by not declining the financier’s overtures with respect
to Miss Dove, for after Mr Falcon’s successful start as
regards his money scheme, he came to the conclusion
that his amatory advances would be accepted both by
father and daughter; he forgot, however, all about his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
cowardly conduct at the lake; but Miss Dove did not,
and the squire told Mr Falcon candidly that his
daughter was quite capable of exercising her own
judgment with respect to matrimonial affairs, so that
he must plead his own cause. The financier took the
hint and used every means in his power to win Miss
Dove’s favour.</p>

<p>One day, when the squire and Doctor Peters, the
village doctor, were fishing, Mr Falcon, who was
walking towards the pond with Miss Dove,
said,—</p>

<p>“Whenever I look at those punts on the water I
am reminded of that rash youth on the Crystal
Palace lake who had the impudence to get into
the water to help to raise you into the boat. I was
most annoyed, Miss Dove, at his stupid officiousness.
As far as I could make out, he was a performer—a
Palace actor or something of that kind.”</p>

<p>“I feel sure,” said Miss Dove, looking very straight
at Mr Falcon, “that he was a clever performer; but I
was told at the Thicket Hotel that he was a scientific
man and a successful one, too,” she added. “I certainly
was vastly absorbed in his experiment.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! I may have been misinformed, but I
quite understood that he was not a regular Palace
balloonist, but a mere experimentalist. Would you
like to know more about him, Miss Edith?” continued
the financier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“Don’t you think, Mr Falcon, that I could very
easily do so, if I were so inclined?”</p>

<p>“No doubt, Miss Dove; but I hope and believe that
you would prefer my acquaintanceship to his?”</p>

<p>“How very strangely you are talking this morning.
I have no idea who or what that gentleman is,
Mr Falcon, but I do hope to see him once more, so
pray let us join my father and the doctor—and I beg
you will not talk in this strain again.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Miss Dove, I shall venture to speak more
plainly soon, in the hope that you will listen to me,
for I—”</p>

<p>“Papa, dear,” cried Edith, as they drew near to the
fishing party, who were resting whilst the gamekeeper
arranged some fishing rods.</p>

<p>After this decisive check to the financier’s love-making,
he strolled away and tried to enjoy a cigarette
on the bank of the pond, while Edith joined her
father and the doctor; and very glad she was of this
opportunity of stopping the financier’s ungracious
and distasteful proposal.</p>

<p>Presumably Mr Falcon’s great object was to get
accepted as quickly as possible, lest some unforeseen
circumstances should arise which might upset his
schemes, such as a sudden change of mind and occupation
on the part of Harry Goodall. Mr Falcon
was, however, secretly prepared with another plan
to prevent Goodall from visiting the Doves, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
intended to try it if he thought it probable that the
aeronaut would give up ballooning as a step to an
introduction to Wedwell Park. And the estate was
worth fighting for—it was 300 acres in extent, well
wooded, and with a grand old mansion in the centre,
surrounded by ornamental gardens. Away towards
the sea there was a good view of the South Downs—altogether
it was a charming spot.</p>

<p>But Edith Dove was not so easily won. She
studiously declined Mr Falcon’s attentions, although
he was not a man to be easily repulsed, for he knew
that in his case there was no time to be lost.</p>

<p>Mr Falcon had thus far managed to keep the
name of Harry Goodall in the background, and,
strange to say, Edith had never been known to fall
in love, although her father and she had many
friends, including county families and distinguished
personages; but they neither of them cared much for
entertaining mere fashionable callers, although given
particularly to hospitality when men of science or
women of celebrity and worth were concerned, even
if they had risen from the more humble ranks of life.</p>

<p>The financier, though not a general favourite at
Wedwell, found a warm supporter in Doctor Peters,
who was the family medical attendant, and was
thought by some to have been a former friend of
Falcon’s, or a relative. But the doctor, who took
instinctively to the financier was a crotchety, inquisitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
old man, and wanted to find out where
Falcon was born, and to dive into family matters,
which he didn’t care to explain. Another reason
why the doctor liked him was because, whilst in
Sydney, he had helped and got into a good situation
a scapegrace connection of the doctor’s.</p>

<p>Although the doctor and Squire Dove were so
partial to fishing, the financier did not care much
for it, as he was no sportsman. Indeed, he had admitted
to the doctor that he was certainly not enamoured
of shooting, as he had been shot himself
very recently, by a rascally fellow who fired at him
down in Essex.</p>

<p>Mr Falcon’s visit that day, to which we are alluding,
was not only to pursue his attentions to Miss Dove,
but also to privately consult his new friend the
doctor, who could give him advice professionally,
and might also expedite, if asked to do so, not only
a forthcoming monetary transaction with the squire,
but the doctor might advise him about introducing
to the notice of the Doves his ideas relative to a
flying machine.</p>

<p>When that great financial affair was satisfactorily
concluded, Doctor Peters was a witness to the squire’s
payment of cash, and to the signature of both to a
deed, after which Mr Falcon went home with the
doctor, as he wished to have a confidential chat
with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>At the outset of what was mutually considered a
consultation, the financier briefly explained that he
had been injured in the lumbar regions, which affected,
as he thought, his spinal cord.</p>

<p>On examination, Doctor Peters, who played his
part admirably so far as humouring the caprices of
his patient went, found that the wound or bruise
was not quite so dangerous as it appeared to be in
his patient’s eyes, though it was not at all improbable,
unless great care was exercised, that a touch of
paralysis might supervene.</p>

<p>“But do tell me,” said the doctor, “how it happened.”</p>

<p>“I was strolling about on a marsh not far from
Tilbury, awaiting the arrival of a vessel when she
passed up the Thames. Just about the same time
another and a lighter craft from a different part and
a higher latitude,” he explained, enigmatically, “hove
in sight. Then two men were landed, who looked
like poachers—one was certainly a very reckless
knight of the trigger, as he fired off a volley of
charges in the direction I was taking. I then felt
a thud in the back, like the kick of a horse, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! Very alarming, no doubt, Mr Falcon.
I should say very likely your injury was caused by
a spent shot, judging from appearances,” said the
doctor, as he further examined the bruise. “Can
you raise and bend both legs with perfect ease?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“No—not—exactly.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I should say it was probably a bullet from a
bull-dog pistol that overtook you, and I have no
hesitation in saying that no mere dust shot would
have produced such a concussion.”</p>

<p>“And yet, doctor, I escaped the rascal and managed
to reach a station and to catch a train.”</p>

<p>“What a lucky escape to be sure!”</p>

<p>“It was; but I felt I was hit near the spine,
and in the leg as well, for I began to limp as I do
now.”</p>

<p>“Ay, we must get rid of that. Now, I’ll tell you
what you must do. I shall provide you with ointment,
pills, draught and what not, besides a little pick-me-up
restorative, and then you must go to your hotel
for a few days and rest, and you must get that smart,
little valet of yours to rub your back and to look
well after you.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t do that, for unfortunately Eben Croft
is down himself and cannot get out. He is positively
pining for my assistance. However, you must be
good enough to accept this bank-note for your advice
and these ample remedies. Now I wish to speak to
you on another subject, and that, of course, will require
another refresher in the way of a fee,” said
Falcon, who evidently meant to ingratiate himself
with Doctor Peters, and then turn him to account respecting
more points than one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“No, no,” cried the doctor, rejecting the further
fee, “enough is as good as a feast.”</p>

<p>“You must oblige, doctor, for I feel that you are
my best friend in these parts, and that you will
advance my suit and prospects here as much as you
can.”</p>

<p>“Pray say no more, Mr Falcon. After this assurance
you may implicitly rely upon my giving you not only
medical but friendly advice. In short, I feel myself, by
some extraordinary fascinating power on your part, to
be drawn to you, and I cannot forget that you did my
relative a good turn in Sydney, and I shall consider
it a duty to espouse your cause here, as long as I find
it to be, as I do now, straight and honourable. But
do tell me how goes it with Miss Edith? She is one
of the purest and most unsophisticated creatures in
the world, and you know her pecuniary value, I daresay,”
said the doctor, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I am pretty well versed on that point,
for our lamented friend, Henry Goodall of Sydney,
whom you have seen and talked to, I believe, acquainted
me with everything concerning the Doves
before I undertook to—”</p>

<p>“Before you undertook to court and carry off Miss
Dove,” interrupted the doctor.</p>

<p>“I did not imply as much as that, doctor, for there
was no understanding between us of that kind I
assure you. However, you may assume that love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
has cropped up, on my side at anyrate, ever since my
arrival.”</p>

<p>“I can very well understand your feelings, Mr
Falcon.”</p>

<p>“Scarcely, I think—for mine have been an unthought
of outburst of admiration, and I may say, of
affection, for Miss Dove—which—”</p>

<p>“My dear sir, is it worth while to analyse all our
secret springs of action, as you and I seem to grasp
them by a sort of intuition, which is common to both
of us, I should say?”</p>

<p>“Good, and altogether far-seeing of you, doctor!
And I quite agree with you, but still I am not carrying
the position in such a dashing style as I expected.
Of course, you know that the squire, so far as he
is concerned, approves of my open and honourable
conduct?”</p>

<p>“He could not fail to do that, Mr Falcon; but why
are you rubbing your eyes so vigorously?”</p>

<p>“Eh! was I? I am not piping my eye for fear
of failure, if that is what you are inferring, doctor.
The fact is my sight has been unduly tried lately. I
took to spectacles for a short spell.”</p>

<p>“More’s the pity. Just let me look into your eyes,
Mr Falcon.”</p>

<p>“Do, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Your eyes are as sound as your heart, my dear
sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Nothing wrong there, you think?”</p>

<p>“Not that I can detect at present; but mind that
you never let Edith Dove see you with blinkers on.”</p>

<p>“Leave me alone for that. Those I wore on trial
proved dangerous.”</p>

<p>“Really—you are a young man and ought not to
have tried them.”</p>

<p>“A young man, eh? I was just thinking of my
young man Croft, and that I must be going; but stay—I
think I heard a rap at your front door.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, I’ll inquire. Now Maria, what is it?”
asked the doctor of a neat little servant.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir, the gentleman is wanted.”</p>

<p>“I really cannot stay to see anyone,” said Mr
Falcon.</p>

<p>“What name was given, Maria?” asked the
doctor.</p>

<p>“Warner, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that name,” said Mr Falcon, who
motioned to his friend to shut the door—“but perhaps
you would kindly see him for me, doctor?”</p>

<p>“Look here, Maria,” said the doctor in a more subdued
tone, “was my patient asked for?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; the man only said he called respecting
Eben Croft.”</p>

<p>“Confound him!” muttered Falcon. “I am not
angry with you, Maria,” he said, turning to the girl,
who looked rather scared; “here is half-a-crown for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
you. I am annoyed by the intrusion just as I was in
conversation with your master.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say who was upstairs, sir.”</p>

<p>“Quite right, Maria,” said the doctor. “Suppose you
keep Mr Warner waiting for a few minutes, and then
show him up.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said Maria.</p>

<p>“And where am I to disappear to, doctor?”
anxiously asked his patient.</p>

<p>“Step into my skeleton case, Mr Falcon, if you are
not too squeamish. It’s quite empty, as the tenant’s
bones were removed last week for fresh articulation;
they were dropping all to pieces.”</p>

<p>“All right! Here’s in, anyhow, and if I scratch my
finger-nail gently on the inside of the door, you will
know that you are saying what I don’t like; but as
long as I keep quiet you can go ahead, doctor; you
understand?”</p>

<p>“Thoroughly. I have unlimited discretionary
power unless you scratch with your finger-nail.”</p>

<p>Doctor Peters having almost closed the door of
case, and hearing footsteps, cried out,—</p>

<p>“Come in, Mr Warner, I am at your service.”</p>

<p>“I must ask your pardon for intruding, doctor. I
was directed to your house, but I’m afraid it is a wild-goose
chase, as I merely want to see a gentleman I
fancy I have met before; but as he seems to have disappeared,
I suppose I must tell you that a young man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
named Eben, or Ebenezer Croft, has referred me to his
master, who was said to be on a visit at Wedwell
Park. This man Croft has got into trouble, sir, and
will have to go before a magistrate.”</p>

<p>“What for, pray?”</p>

<p>“For trespassing on the company’s private premises
at the Crystal Palace, sir.”</p>

<p>“What a paltry charge, Mr Warner! I may
possibly mention the case to Squire Dove, who is a
Justice of the Peace, and acquainted, I know, with
some of the most influential directors and shareholders
of the palace. The squire will no doubt see that the
case is thoroughly looked into, even if it comes to an
exposure in the <i>Times</i>. Yes, sir,” continued the
doctor, “this farcical seizure of poor little Croft, who
is a gentleman’s servant, will no doubt make a great
stir and keep people from visiting the palace, lest they
step accidently from public to private rooms, which
most likely join each other.”</p>

<p>“Something more will come out about the premises
that have been entered,” said Warner, “as they belong
to a scientific gentleman, whose friends are, I believe,
acquainted with Squire Dove.” (A loudish scratch).</p>

<p>“May be, Mr Warner; Croft has only committed
a pardonable mistake—but if bail is required it will
be forthcoming.” (A whisper from the case, “Shut
up!”)</p>

<p>“The truth is, Doctor Peters, that Croft is locked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
up, and he fears that his master is in the same
predicament.”</p>

<p>“My good man, what nonsense!” cried the
doctor.</p>

<p>“Nonsense you may think it. However, I am
merely doing my duty in making inquiries; but don’t
you suppose that I am a fool, sir.”</p>

<p>“You are far from that, I’m sure; but allow me,
Warner, to present you with this,” replied the doctor,
putting his finger and thumb into his waistcoat
pocket.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, sir; I am neither to be bought,
sold nor humbugged, and I’ll wish you good-day;” and
the man took up his hat and departed angrily.</p>

<p>Whilst Warner was walking away down a bye
lane, he met a good-natured looking young person,
whose face seemed familiar to him.</p>

<p>“What, Lucy!” he exclaimed; “is that you, miss?
How pleased I am to see you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lucy is my name, it’s true; but surely I have
seen you at the Crystal Palace?”</p>

<p>“Certainly you have—at Mr Goodall’s workroom,
when I was chatting with Tom Trigger after Miss
Chain had been frightened by that spy who is not
so very far off, unless I’m much mistaken, Miss Lucy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do come into the gamekeeper’s cottage with
me; I am going to see Bennet.”</p>

<p>“Ay, come in and welcome,” said the gamekeeper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
who was standing at his garden gate. “Did I hear
you say that you know Tom Trigger?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know Tom, and like him very much.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” replied the gamekeeper, “and I found
him a good shot, too, when he came down with
Lucy.”</p>

<p>“Nothing amiss with Tom?” asked Lucy, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Oh dear no, and never will be, my dear,” said
Warner. “Don’t you fear. It is that little audacious
chap Croft I came about.”</p>

<p>“Are you going back by the next or the last train?”
asked Bennet.</p>

<p>“By the next; I must if possible,” replied Warner.</p>

<p>“Then make haste, missus,” said Bennet, turning
to his wife, “and get us a cup of tea. I’m going over
to the station and will give you a lift,” he said to
Warner, “and we can go on with our chat on the
road.”</p>

<p>The snug little tea-party had barely sat down when
Mrs Bennet heard a knock at the door, and then in
came Saunders, the cook, from the house, who had
been sent down by Miss Dove with her customary
basket of odds and ends, but she did not know that
Lucy and a stranger were there.</p>

<p>When Saunders was introduced to Warner, she exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Bless me, I ought to know that name; and now I
look at you— But don’t you know me, Simon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“Why, goodness me! it’s surely never Miss Saunders?”</p>

<p>“The same, sir, as I was when I knew you in
Sydenham. You thought at that time of entering the
force.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and so I did. How glad I am to see you
again.”</p>

<p>After some further chatting over old times,
Saunders remembered the dinner she had to cook,
and rose to leave.</p>

<p>“It’s about time we were moving too,” said Bennet
to Warner, “that is, if you must catch the next train.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I really must,” said Warner, getting up and
shaking hands with them all and saying that he
hoped to pay them another visit some day.</p>

<p>“Give my love to Tom,” cried Lucy to Warner, as
he jumped up beside Bennet in the cart, “and tell
him to try and come and see me soon again,” she added,
as they disappeared down the lane.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>MR FALCON ON FLIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the financier was considering whether he
should leave Doctor Peters at once or wait, so as to
avoid getting in contact with Warner, it occurred to
him that he might stay a while and sound his adviser
as to the other scheme he had been thinking about ever
since Eben Croft purloined from Mr Goodall’s workroom
a treatise on “Flight” by Professor Scudder.</p>

<p>The possession of this manuscript by Mr Falcon,
induced him to decide upon utilising the suggestions
therein contained, for he had not forgotten the discomfiture
he met with on the Crystal Palace lake, and he
longed for an opportunity of surpassing the air-ship performance
of Harry Goodall, which made such a favourable
impression on Miss Dove before the amateur
aeronaut rescued her from a watery grave. Thus
animated with entirely new notions, the financier requested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Doctor Peters to listen while he explained a
scheme by which he hoped further to raise himself in
the estimation of Squire Dove and his daughter.</p>

<p>The doctor at first felt disinclined to devote any
time and attention to the affairs of his visitor, and he
was on the point of saying “Shut up” (as Mr Falcon
had done when he whispered from the skeleton case).
The doctor, however, still mindful of the financier’s
liberal fees, consented to hear what he had to say,
but begged that Mr Falcon would be concise, as he
was not disposed to go into scientific arguments or a
lengthy preamble, nor could he listen to profound
calculations. “For you must not forget, Mr Falcon,”
he said, “that in Surgery and Pathology we dislike
complications,” and he knew that figures could be
easily made to embarrass the uninitiated and to deceive
scientists as well. “So do unfold your wings,
tail and what not with simplicity of diction.”</p>

<p>“You may rely on my doing that, doctor, but first
let me inform you that I have not long since visited a
noted tower in which a valuable work on flying was
deposited, and it was there that my servant Eben
Croft dropped into the storeroom, where he picked up
a rare and original manuscript on ‘Flight,’ by Professor
Scudder.”</p>

<p>“And this, I suppose, Mr Falcon, has taken a firm
hold of your mind?”</p>

<p>“Exactly, doctor—after I had obtained a firm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
hold of the book. Then I went deeply into the
subject, but I had thought about the matter previously.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Mr Falcon, I was not aware of that. Maybe
it was after you had studied and appropriated
some of Scudder’s notions?”</p>

<p>“Mind, Peters, what you are insinuating.”</p>

<p>“Quite so! I merely say and mean that you, as a
man of action, felt called upon to give life, energy and
force to Scudder’s proposals, having most likely modified
and improved his early conceptions.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s something in the way you now put
it, doctor, for it is unquestionable that my own views
present a more attractive programme, if I may use the
term, than Scudder’s did.”</p>

<p>“And who the dickens is Scudder, pray?”</p>

<p>“Scudder himself hails from Holland.”</p>

<p>“Ay, he is the veritable Flying Dutchman, no
doubt; but is he a man of aeronautical experience,
Mr Falcon?”</p>

<p>“Not so much as I am, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Where have you matriculated?”</p>

<p>“I have devoted considerable attention to the movements
and acts of a clever balloonist.”</p>

<p>“What! you have, Mr Falcon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that is strictly confidential, and I want
it to go no further, please.”</p>

<p>“Say no more, Mr Falcon, on that head, but at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
once propound your theory, for I am curious to hear
why you have two strings to your bow.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What is that you say about my bow?”</p>

<p>“I was adverting to your contemplating ‘Flight,’
while you have so great an attractive power in Miss
Dove. Couldn’t you remain within the sphere of her
influence?”</p>

<p>“Of course I could; but aren’t you a bit wandering
yourself, doctor? You spoke of my having two
strings to my bow.”</p>

<p>“What I meant was, that as a financial suitor you
pose well, but as a flying man you would not, I think,
appear to advantage.”</p>

<p>“Would it surprise you to hear, doctor, that Miss
Dove has a taste for aerial exploration?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense, my dear sir. Surely I ought to know
more about that than you. However, tell me more
of your flying machine ideas.”</p>

<p>“You must know then, doctor, that the main-spring
of it consists of a huge steel bow, and I thought you
might have heard something of this when you alluded
to my having two strings to my bow.”</p>

<p>“No; I have heard nothing whatever of your plans,
but never mind about the two strings, Mr Falcon, so
that you stick to one bow.”</p>

<p>“You may be sure I shall do that, for it is by this
power I shall be able to ascend.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Mr Falcon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“To be more explicit, doctor, I shall first pass into
space through the instrumentality of an enormous
cross-bow.”</p>

<p>“Then you will be the arrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and will face the inevitable like a bird.”</p>

<p>“Ay, like a Falcon, you might have said.”</p>

<p>“Mind, doctor, what use you make of an unsullied
name.”</p>

<p>“I shall do it no harm if you don’t yourself, sir;
but say what you like, Mr Falcon, I don’t believe you
will ever fly unless you have a limb of the law at
your heels.”</p>

<p>“Your candid opinion is not very encouraging,
doctor, but it will not discourage me from enlightening
your darkness.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I want more light as to your flighty ideas,
for I am no air explorer and have never even been up
the City Monument, or the Crystal Palace towers.
Have you, Mr Falcon?”</p>

<p>“Many a time and oft, doctor. Why, it was at
the palace tower where I came across Scudder’s
book.”</p>

<p>“Was it really? Do go on then, though I fear this
flying fad will bewilder you before you chuck it
up.”</p>

<p>“Hear me out, doctor.”</p>

<p>“By all means, for I fail to see how you are going
to do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“I am not going to imitate the tactics of previous
sky soarers, but I do hold with Scudder as to a good
dashing start.”</p>

<p>“You won’t dash into a horse pond, a limekiln, or
a railway train, I trust.”</p>

<p>“No fear, doctor. With my first spring I shall be
hurled clear of all such impediments.”</p>

<p>“You say hurled, Mr Falcon. Why, you almost
take my breath away.”</p>

<p>“That is because you lack imagination, doctor, or
you would picture to yourself my contrivance in
full swing on the lawn in front of Wedwell
Hall.”</p>

<p>“God forbid that I should witness such a scene!”</p>

<p>“Simply because you fail, Peters, to see in your
mind’s eye the merit of the invention. Can’t you
imagine an enormous cross-bow, with two large
grooves in the stock for the air-ship to slide up
when the bow is bent and the trigger pulled?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t see it.”</p>

<p>“You will presently when I further explain that
these grooves will be three feet apart, and that the
car or sledge of the air-craft will slide up these
grooves, as two half round pieces of wood will be
fastened at the bottom of the sledge. Of course the
wire cord of the great steel bow will be drawn down
and fixed behind the air machine before the trigger
is pulled.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“And how long after this bit of trigger-nometry
do you expect to be alive, man?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be all right; you will see soon how
the thing will work.”</p>

<p>“Never, I fear.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll try to make you, anyhow; and don’t
forget, doctor, that the craft or cruiser (call it which
you like) will narrow at the stem.”</p>

<p>“What for, Mr Falcon?”</p>

<p>“What for? Why, to cleave the air like a thing of
life, so that when the wings are opened out by touching
a lever then the pace will be prodigious, though,
at first, the machine will have the wings closed up
like the arms of a diver before he springs, but once
away I should go clean over Wedwell Park.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, provided you got over the squire and
the Hall.”</p>

<p>“Hear me out, doctor, while I tell you that the
great cross-bow stock will be raised on blocks to an
angle of 25 degrees, in order that my first leap into
space should shoot me clear of the housetops until
my wings opened for practical work.”</p>

<p>“Why, man, you would go like a projectile, and, to
my thinking, you would be launched into eternity.”</p>

<p>“Should I really. You’re wrong there, Peters;
only think how divers sometimes drop from great
heights and then turn up safely like corks.”</p>

<p>“But your turn up, Mr Falcon, according to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
own account, would last for more than a few seconds,
and in that time your senses (or what was left of
them) would be whisked out of you in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>“You forget, doctor, that when I reached the park
boundaries I should slow down a bit and bring into
use my motive power, for without that, I should drop
by the run.”</p>

<p>“Just like De Groof did, Mr Falcon, when he
was killed at Chelsea over twenty years ago.”</p>

<p>“That poor man was not kept moving on. He
wanted propelling, or some other force, as I shall
employ.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean police force, possibly?”</p>

<p>“No, something stronger than that, or electricity
either.”</p>

<p>“Compressed air, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“You must excuse me stating my power, doctor,
for to a man of your sensitive nature it might sound
alarming.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s hesitation, Mr Falcon lifted his
hand and struck the table so violently that he made
a wine glass jump until it fell and was smashed on
the carpet. He then said without the least apology,—</p>

<p>“My driving power, doctor, will be worked by an
explosive!”</p>

<p>“An explosive! I hope it won’t blow you to atoms
like the pieces of glass around us.”</p>

<p>“No fear, Peters; I am free, however, to admit that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
a succession of explosions will produce a rocket-like
movement. But you will excuse me, won’t you, for
not naming the chemical compound employed?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about that, Mr Falcon. I am
quite convinced as to the violent nature of it, and
I won’t press you for a further exposition of your
new motive power; indeed, I perceive that, at the
outset, you will go up (unless you funk it) like a live
military shell or rocket. Secondly, that you will
have folding wings to your craft; and thirdly, that
by the aid of explosive materials, you will set these
in motion, so that you can flap, sail, whirl or swoop.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the swooping, doctor; that might be
resorted to in a desperate emergency.”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the last scene of a closing act, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you be so jocular and ironical, doctor. You
have done me one good turn, and I want you to do
another by taking this fresh matter up warmly, and
further by introducing it to the Doves.”</p>

<p>“Not I, Mr Falcon. For my part I shall drop it
from this moment like a hot cinder, and I strongly
recommend you to do the same, and to concentrate
your attentions on Miss Dove simply as a financial
projector rather than as a man of flight.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do believe, doctor, that you advise me as
a true friend, and I will not attempt even a preliminary
canter in the park before I have tried an
experiment elsewhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“Don’t try to fly, but go at once to Sydenham, Mr
Falcon, and see that Eben Croft is set free from
durance vile.”</p>

<p>“A bright idea, doctor, and a very suggestive one,
too; and, for your concluding hint, I thank you very
much, and I promise faithfully to turn it to account.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>A FLIGHTY FIASCO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> following the advice of Doctor Peters by
liberating Eben Croft, Mr Falcon determined that he
would forthwith turn him to another useful account,
as the financier had decided to test Scudder’s scheme
if the Pocket Hercules would assist him to do so,—though,
in consideration of the objections raised by
his adviser Peters, Mr Falcon thought it would be
quite as well if he abstained himself from going aloft,
should Croft agree to do so and assume the Dutchman’s
name.</p>

<p>An immediate proposal was therefore made to
Professor Scudder, who soon replied favourably from
Rotterdam, in fact he consented to sell his stolen
manuscript and invention for the round sum down of
one hundred pounds sterling, and these terms, having
been arranged, Eben Croft was duly informed that
there was one more chance open to him if he really
wished to hand down his name to posterity, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
which he could see about settling in his promised
“pub” near Wedwell Park, but not until his master
had united himself in the bonds of matrimony to
the squire’s daughter.</p>

<p>Eben having agreed, Falcon promised to remunerate
him handsomely if he would assume the <i>rôle</i> of
Scudder and make the first trial of the flying
machine (of course in disguise, so that no one would
know him). As to Mr Falcon, he would pose as a distinguished
Dutch director, and would arrange everything
at some quiet place where the experiment could
come off under the strictest privacy; but the chosen
spot would not have to be very far from Wedwell
Park in case the wind happened to waft the aerial
cruiser that way,—in which case Mr Falcon might
like himself to make the flight personally,—but that
would not interfere with the stipulated payment to
Eben Croft. The entire apparatus, including Scudder’s
giant cross-bow, was very soon the property of the
flying financier, but, unfortunately, there was a debt
on it of fifty ducats,—which had to be cleared off
before the contrivance was despatched from Rotterdam.</p>

<p>A suitable place at Haywards Heath was at length
hired by the financier, and the flying machine, with
cross-bow, appurtenances and propellers, were to be
sent by goods train to the Sussex Station, where, in
expectation of their arrival, Mr Falcon and Eben<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Croft duly presented themselves in costume that
would defy detection.</p>

<p>A number of workmen, under the superintendence
of a master carpenter, had been engaged at the quiet
retreat selected, which, by the way, was not far from
the lunatic asylum in the neighbourhood of Haywards
Heath, when Croft, in a semi-clerical attire, assisted his
master to make the preliminary arrangements;—then
Eben said,—</p>

<p>“Where shall I find the tackle, sir?”</p>

<p>“At the Haywards Heath Goods Station, Eben.”</p>

<p>“Is it to be a public or private affair?”</p>

<p>“As secret and secluded as possible. Not a soul
must know who or what I am aiming at, Croft, for
this flying machine is to go into Wedwell Park if
you can so manage it, and if I were certain about its
doing so I might occupy the seat of honour myself.”</p>

<p>“Where is Wedwell, sir, from our present standpoint?”</p>

<p>“Yonder; but keep everything dark, Eben. We must
say as little as we can, and that in broken English,
with a strong Dutch accent. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yah, yah, mynheer; but some of your helps are
coming. I had better get to work directly the boss
gets here with the traps.”</p>

<p>“You have seen, Eben, all Scudder’s sketches and
know the plan of the invention. Say as little as need
be, and make the most of the time present.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“Yes, for it would never do, sir, for Jack Hawksworth
or Simon Warner to catch us at this job.”</p>

<p>“No, Eben, nor for Doctor Peters or the squire to
cast eyes upon us.”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t know us, I’m thinking, Mr F.”</p>

<p>“The doctor might recognise and denounce the
contrivance. That is why I have drawn you aside to
speak in confidence, and to say, ‘Hurry on; get the
job over and let us clear out with all speed.’”</p>

<p>Before the experimentalists had taken up their
position in the small grounds which had been hired
for the occasion, Mr Falcon had given out that two
foreigners were about to try a new projectile, and as
an explosive machine would be employed, no spectators
would be admitted near the apparatus nor inside
the premises on any pretext whatsoever; neither
would admittance to the enclosed retreat be allowed
even on payment of gate money.</p>

<p>But no sooner had the proceedings got fairly forward
and the large steel bow and stock appeared in
the distance, than the outsiders conjectured that the
foreign visitors were certainly about to try the working
of a new sort of guillotine for the beheading of
anarchists and other criminals. The ominous sounds
that had been heard by carpenters and the workmen
encouraged this conclusion, and when the twisted
wire of the bow was strained tight behind the air-craft,
and it was made to perform a preliminary move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
up and down the two grooves in the bow-stock, then
many persons broke into the grounds, much to the
annoyance of the tall, distinguished-looking Dutchman
who was at work conjointly with a London firework
manufacturer, both of whom were in the act of
charging a double-barrelled explosive machine—this
was intended to act as an additional motor power
to the professor’s aerial cruise after the first spring
into the air, produced by the cross-bow, had ceased
to act.</p>

<p>Eben Croft, who was supposed by all present, with
the exception of his principal, Mr Falcon, to be the
redoubtable Scudder, was well to the fore, and had
fearlessly mounted the seat of the air-ship, when he
was asked by one of the local magnates if he required
any assistance.</p>

<p>Thereupon, the supposed Scudder, who seemed reluctant
to air his Dutch or broken English, pointed
towards his chief and tried to catch his attention, but
the crowd had so surrounded Mr Falcon, that the attentive
interrogator asked if the professor was wanting
the Dutch gentleman with the long black beard.</p>

<p>“Yah, yah, mynheer,” replied Eben. “Vil you tell
de herr dat I vant mine propellers?”</p>

<p>“Come on, Herr What’s-your-name,” cried the
master carpenter to Falcon, not knowing his name—when
suddenly and unexpectedly a terrific explosion
took place, which hurled Mr Falcon, the firework<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
maker and others into an adjacent pond, into which
the burly Dutchman went head foremost and lost
his big beard and curly locks; in fact his hairy adornments
were floating on the water, and had he been
the sole sufferer there would have been a scene of
laughter as well as of commotion, but several townsmen
and strangers were injured besides the dark,
stout fellow (Falcon), who, on being dragged on to
land, seemed strangely transmogrified until some kind
friend re-adjusted him, when he appeared to have lost
his head, for he sung out to the professor in clear
English,—</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, Eben, get your power and
start at once. Your wings are attached, and you’ve
an open country before you. Make a short spin at
all risks.”</p>

<p>“Pull that trigger, master carpenter,” cried the supposed
Scudder, in downright, plain, unbroken English.</p>

<p>The carpenter and all the people within earshot were
bewildered, and thought they were going to be hoaxed,
but up rushed the wild, half-crazy Falcon and pulled
furiously at the line, when away went Scudder like a
bolt out of a forty-pounder, his hat and coat-tails flying
behind him; but he had the presence of mind to let
loose, by touching a lever, his wings, which flew open
in time to give him a check just as he turned downwards,
for all the world as if he were making for the
lunatic asylum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“He’ll pitch into yonder trees, mark my word if he
doesn’t,” cried Falcon, as if that curve was designed
to be the extent of his voyage.</p>

<p>“Ah, he’s a dead man,” cried the master carpenter,
“though a pluct ’un, and no mistake!”</p>

<p>“Yes, there he goes into that clump of lofty trees
like a heron to his nest,” said a workman.</p>

<p>“On to his rescue, men,” cried some gentlemen of
position. Then the grounds were soon vacated after
the professor had smashed through the upper leaves
and broken the framework of his wings.</p>

<p>Falcon noticed that he held up his arms and waved
them as a signal of safety, but some of the bystanders
protested that he was knocked all to pieces, a result
which Falcon and the master carpenter disbelieved,
seeing that he took the tree tops as if it was the only
suitable place upon which to alight, in order to
save himself and the air-ship, though Eben’s master
could see that it was by extraordinary good luck
he did not dash into the asylum yard, which was
not very far off, and which might have killed him
outright.</p>

<p>Scudder, who had well enacted his part, was so embedded
in the leaves and boughs, that ladders had to
be procured before any assistance could be rendered,
but as the foreman of the carpenters ran back to say
that Scudder was not killed, only scratched a bit,
Mr Falcon affected to feel somewhat restored, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
he was quite unable to go with the mob to see about
Scudder’s landing.</p>

<p>“Still,” said Falcon to the master carpenter, “I
must return immediately to London and report the
success of the first flight under such extreme disadvantages.”</p>

<p>“And are you,” said the tradesman, “going to
take to flight yourself? Who then is to settle up
with me?”</p>

<p>“I will,” cried Falcon, “as soon as you like; that
is, if you will help us to get away by the next
train.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you won’t do that, but there is one
due in an hour and a half. At the same time, if
you will go to my house and dry your clothes and
settle the little account, my foreman shall see about
your Professor Scudder, as you call him, and very
aptly so, too, I think.”</p>

<p>Mr Falcon, finding that the master carpenter was
resolved to stick to him, and that his foreman was
instructed by signs and whispers not to lose sight
of the little man, requested that Eben’s hat be
restored to him with his other garments, which were
picked up and found to be quite safe. Then Herr
What’s-his-name, or, in plainer and more direct terms,
Mr Falcon, saw the policy of assenting to all that
had been proposed, and was truly glad to think that
he would have so good a chance of leaving before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
any interference on the part of the local authorities
or police had been ordered.</p>

<p>“Mind you,” added his counsellor, “if you want
to avoid being questioned and perhaps detained for
attempted homicide, or anything that might lead to
further inquiry, you take my advice and leave by
the next train.”</p>

<p>Seeing what a fix they might soon get in, Mr
Falcon forthwith went to the master carpenter’s
house, changed and dried his clothes, paid his bill,
arranged that Eben Croft was to be brought to
him from where he was and then the financier made
fresh terms for getting all his traps together and
paid for their carriage up to goodness knows where,
no matter what state they might be in, and if the
carpenter and his foreman would undertake to dispatch
them with expedition, Falcon would pay extra,
and handsomely, too.</p>

<p>This business-like offer had the desired effect, every
man employed worked with a will. The tackle,
much shattered, was taken down in a van. Scudder
had his scratches and wounds seen to, and they
just cleared out from the railway station when one
or two plain clothes officers began inquiring about
the health and residence of the foreigners, but the
train was in motion, and the flying financier and
his confederate were off before they were formally
interviewed by the police, who rather winked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
their escape, as they had caused no end of stir and
amusement even among the demented sightseers, one
of whom thought that the crazy man of flight was
about to join them, as he was himself seemingly
under the influence of a lunar complaint.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>CAPTAIN LINK’S APPEARANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Mr Falcon had been scheming in Sussex,
Harry Goodall, on returning to the Crystal Palace,
found that as his first ascent had proved such a
great success, he would immediately try to guard
against public gossip respecting the diabolical attempt
which had been made to damage his balloon,
in case the palace authorities might be induced to
stop any further experiments.</p>

<p>Unquestionably, the erratic visits of the mysterious
spy and his little satellite showed that the delinquent
on the Essex marsh, the “shadow man” and the
man on the North Tower with Eben Croft, were
one and the same. The aeronaut felt sure that if
these men were seen to be dogging his footsteps,
the palace directors would not feel disposed to allow
another aerial trip.</p>

<p>Tom Trigger and his master had well considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
what had taken place, and Miss Chain and her mother
were duly cautioned against alluding to the suspicious
strangers, and were also requested not to
tell Hawksworth the detective anything that had
taken place.</p>

<p>On thinking over the matter, it then had occurred
to Trigger that he had seen someone very like
Ebenezer Croft at the place where Lucy was in
service, and he had mentioned this to Warner,
who was sent down by the palace police inspector
to pick up what information he could at Wedwell
Park, the results of which were given in Chapter
VII., and which led to the discharge of Croft as
a matter of expediency; so that, notwithstanding
the disparaging remarks of Hawksworth, Warner
had obtained something like a clue or two and
had turned them to a good account, after he left
Wedwell.</p>

<p>On Harry Goodall’s next visit to the Crystal Palace,
it was found that little damage had been done to the
workroom stores, beyond the theft of a paper on
“Flight.” This trifling plunder was doubtless owing
to Warner’s watchfulness, who, in his quiet, unpretending
manner was always on the alert.</p>

<p>There being nothing, therefore, to prevent the
making of a second ascent, the aeronaut was determined
to proceed with it forthwith, so that not more
than a fortnight elapsed before the balloon was again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
brought out for inflation; and as the former trial
trip had created such general admiration, the manager
quite regretted that these aerial exploitings were to
be made without public announcement. There was,
however, no moving the amateur from his decision.
He had so little of the showman in his composition
that he did not care for spectators of his skill,
though he was ready to study the gratification of
those who honoured him with their presence, and
this he considered to be a proper return for the
advantages afforded him at such an admirable
spot for ballooning, as the palace proved to be.</p>

<p>While preparations were being made in the glass-room,
a gentleman presented himself, not a “shadow
man” or Tower sneak this time, but a welcome guest.
He was no other than Captain Link, who had seen his
young friend’s balloon when it passed over the
<i>Neptune</i> as she was going up the Thames, and who
now came to have a chat with Harry, not only on his
own account, but as the representative of Mr William
Goodall, who believed that the straightforward, outspoken
seaman would do more to convert his nephew
than the Quixotic performances of Mr Falcon, of
whom the merchant had formed an unfavourable
opinion.</p>

<p>Captain Link suggested that whilst Tom Trigger
and a gang of the palace gardeners were making
arrangements for the filling, that he and Harry should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
take a turn round the gardens, and have a cigar
together.</p>

<p>“I want to know, Link,” said the delighted aeronaut,
“if my uncle saw the balloon as we crossed your mast
heads?”</p>

<p>“Of course he did, long before you recognised us,
which I suppose you did; but he was depressed about
a matter which has been troubling us, and just as the
tug’s black smoke rose up to you, I gave him a letter
to read which I had in my pocket, and it brightened
him up considerably. However, I was requested not
to say anything to you about family matters. Your
uncle said that I was to be strictly silent on that
point, for he felt sure that nothing I could say would
stop you from accomplishing whatever you had
engaged to do, so for to-day, Harry, we won’t allude
to anything but your favourite ballooning, please, and
your proposed companions, of whom I am curious to
hear something, if you have no objection. I was told
before I spoke to you that you were going to ascend
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Yes; stay and join me, Link.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Well, join me at luncheon and see me off; I shall
rely upon your doing that much, at anyrate, and
perhaps more, eh?”</p>

<p>“Very pleased, but I must tell you candidly that
your uncle is still dead set against ballooning; however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
he thinks that you should not break faith here
with the palace people, although he did ask me to try
and persuade you not to continue your ascents after
to-day, as a Mr Falcon is making a mess of his
mission to you.”</p>

<p>“I was not aware that anyone had been here in the
character of a missionary. The only persons I have
noticed are two downright scoundrels who have been
hanging about and haunting me, if I may use the expression,
and not only me, but also Miss Chain and
her mother, two ladies who are assisting me in my
work, and who are really above this kind of thing.
You noticed Miss Chain, probably?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that demure and lady-like girl
I saw at needlework, sitting near that smart-looking
man?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, Link; but I must give him the cold
shoulder, as he is becoming a nuisance, and is a
detective, I hear. The Chains are most industrious,
but were robbed of all they possessed by an unprincipled
financier.”</p>

<p>“What a shame! If this young lady is a sample
of your employees, I am agreeably surprised, Harry,
for they were described to your uncle as being very
different kind of people to this specimen I happen to
have seen. Couldn’t something be done for such a
lady-like girl?”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking on that point myself; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
poor girl has been terribly bothered by an inquisitive
fellow, who has made himself most obnoxious. By
the way, he is a fine, aristocratic-looking man, not
unlike you in build, Link, but he has such an evil
expression of face, whilst you have a good one—but
I must not flatter you.”</p>

<p>“No, pray don’t descend to that, Goodall.”</p>

<p>“Situated, however, as I am, Link, I cannot very
well raise a complaint here to the manager, but I am
all ready for the fellow if he should show up again,
and we fortunately have an obliging but humble-minded
policeman on the lookout. I don’t mean that
fussy, amateurish detective, but a quiet, practical man,
who has already made an example of one fellow. His
name is Warner, and look here, Link, if you can
find an opportunity of having a word or two with
the Chains, I should appreciate the attention, as they
have been so much traduced to my Uncle Goodall.”</p>

<p>“All right, Harry, and I have made up my mind to
stay and see who goes up, as I should like to be
able to speak as I find of your associates.”</p>

<p>“As to those going up—Miss Chain will accompany
me for one, and my assistant, Trigger. I promised
the young lady a trip for her indefatigable work and
general assistance.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me any more of this prodigy, Harry.
Remember that I am a bachelor and a sailor,” said the
captain, laughing heartily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“I don’t forget that, old friend, but I want you to
know that Miss Chain is a much-maligned young
lady; she and her mother were in a state of downright
want when Tom Trigger introduced them to
me.”</p>

<p>“And you will never regret having done them a
good turn, and now that I am reminded of your
sterling qualities, Harry, I really must tell you something
your uncle asked me last evening. He wanted
to know if I could bring you to think more about
commercial and matrimonial affairs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know very well what he and my father
want me to do, but I don’t see it at present.”</p>

<p>“I told him that I didn’t much care about speaking
to you on such subjects, and that I was more likely to
be converted by you, as I had always had a desire to
go up in a balloon.”</p>

<p>“And what did my uncle say to that, Link?”</p>

<p>“He said he didn’t mind what I did, even if I took
you to sea with me, so long as I led you out of the
way of ballooning.”</p>

<p>“And suppose that I lead you away into the upper
regions over land and sea, what would my uncle say
then?”</p>

<p>“Why, I should lose my character and my ship, too,
very likely,” replied Link, with consternation plainly
written on his face.</p>

<p>“Not you, captain; you’ve too much mettle in you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
to be cast aside for preaching to me in cloudland.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! I never thought of that idea, Harry—I
mean as a reason for going up.”</p>

<p>“How do you know, Link, what experiment I am
going to try this very day?”</p>

<p>“I don’t, and that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“Can you answer this question, Link? Where are
marriages made?”</p>

<p>“Up aloft, they say.”</p>

<p>“Then how do you know that I am not going
aloft, with you, for all I know, to invoke Cupid’s
aid as to the knotty matrimonial problem?” said
Harry, jokingly.</p>

<p>“I don’t profess to understand your lofty intentions,
Goodall; they present such a romantic and fascinating
aspect that I must agree to join you in
testing them—if you will give me a lift up for that
purpose; but you are solely responsible, mind, for
raising such a spirit of inquiry.”</p>

<p>“There, for goodness’ sake, Link, let us stop joking.
Here comes Miss Chain. I expect she has something
to say to me about ascending.”</p>

<p>“Do introduce me, Goodall. I saw her coming before
you did, and also that detective party who is
not far astern of Miss Chain—perhaps he is her
admirer.”</p>

<p>“Can’t fail to be that, Link; but just now Hawksworth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
is looking at a photograph, and now he is looking
at us.”</p>

<p>“So he is. Perhaps he is wondering who I am.
He is sheering off now—but who is this trying to
catch your eye on the other side, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Warner; he comes from the palace,
where I am wanted, most likely. However, I will
introduce you to the young lady.—Miss Chain, may
I introduce to you an old friend of mine, Captain
Link?” added Harry, as she came up to speak to him.</p>

<p>“I feel it a great honour, Captain Link, to become
acquainted with a friend of my esteemed employer,”
said Miss Chain.</p>

<p>“I shall have to leave you, Link, for a short time,”
said Mr Goodall, “as the general manager wishes to
see me. You will be back in time to ascend, Miss
Chain?”</p>

<p>“I shall not be gone long, Mr Goodall,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>Captain Link strolled on with Miss Chain, listening
with delight to her conversation, and did not
observe that they had passed the turnstiles and were
going down the Anerley Road, towards where Mrs
Chain lived. Presently, when close to the Thicket
Hotel, they noticed two men coming towards them,
whom Miss Chain at once recognised as her tormentors,
and, strange to say, their faces seemed also
familiar to Captain Link. This coincidence puzzled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
the young lady greatly, as she had thought at first
that there was some personal resemblance between
the taller one and her escort. When the men caught
sight of Captain Link, they hurried away, much to
his annoyance, as he wished that they had stopped
long enough for him to remember their names and
where he had seen them before.</p>

<p>Whilst talking on this subject, Miss Chain observed
her mother, who was on the lookout for her return,
and wished that Captain Link would say good-bye;
but in that respect she was disappointed, as he presently
remarked that he should very much like to
be introduced to Mrs Chain, and after that he would
go to the Thicket Hotel and try to find out who those
men were, and would return in half an hour’s time
to walk back to the palace with Miss Chain and her
mother, if agreeable to them.</p>

<p>On this understanding, Captain Link exchanged a
few words with Mrs Chain and then went on to the
hotel, where he met Warner, who had himself been
looking for the two spies, as there had been a police
rumour that Hawksworth was expecting the arrival
of some such men, and Warner inferred that they
had actually been in the palace before, but that
Hawksworth had failed to spot them. However, not
finding them at the Thicket as he expected, Warner
remarked that they might possibly have popped over
the palings, or through a side gate, into the palace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
grounds, and he asked the captain, if he saw him at
the entrance turnstile, not to take any notice of him,
as he might be on the lookout for suspicious
visitors.</p>

<p>On returning to the Chains, Captain Link remarked
that it had flashed across his mind that the
two men must have been passengers on board the
<i>Neptune</i>, the last ship he came to England in, but
he could not recall their names, being a bad hand
at that sort of thing.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” asked Miss Chain, “if Filcher
was the name of the more gentlemanly one of the
two men?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think that was it.”</p>

<p>“Was it Croft, Captain Link?”</p>

<p>“Well, one of them answered to the name of Croft,
and now I recollect that it was the name of the
little man; but his master’s—let me see, I have it
now—he was called Falcon, and he was my employer’s
friend—or, I should say, he passed as such
for some time after the owner of the ship had left
Sydney. However, we will not say more about them
at present.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad,” said Mrs Chain, as they drew
nearer to the palace, “that you were with my
daughter, Captain Link, when those suspicious men
turned up again.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I am proud to have met Miss Chain; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
do you know, I have some idea of ascending this
afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the mother, “that will be nice,
and I hope you will all have an enjoyable
trip.”</p>

<p>“I want to ask you,” said the captain, “as we are
getting near to the balloon, not to say anything to
my friend, Mr Harry Goodall, about this man Falcon,
or Filcher Falcon as William Goodall styles him—or
of any family accident or bereavement in the
Goodall family of which you may have heard.”</p>

<p>“We certainly will not,” said Miss Chain.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said the sailor, “did you notice a
man walking near you, just before we met in the
grounds?”</p>

<p>“I did,” replied Miss Chain. “He was Hawksworth,
the gentlemanly detective, but not, I should
say, a clever one.”</p>

<p>“Then Warner is only an ordinary policeman, I
suppose?” said Captain Link.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs Chain, “he is in plain clothes to-day,
at present, however; he never parades about
or makes so much of himself as this stranger Hawksworth
does.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” replied the captain—“but dear me,
time has been on the wing. Why, the balloon is
nearly full.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we must hurry on, dear,” said Mrs Chain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
to her daughter. “I’m afraid we are much later than
we promised to be.”</p>

<p>“I see,” cried the captain, “that my friend Harry
Goodall seems to be chatting with several gentlemen
who are much interested in what he is going to do.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Miss Chain, “if they are candidates
for a trip?”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” replied the anxious mariner.</p>

<p>“I will ask,” said Miss Chain, “a palace official,
who is coming our way, if any of them wish to go up.”</p>

<p>“I think not,” was the reply. “Some of them are
distinguished visitors, who are delighted with Mr
Goodall and his balloon.”</p>

<p>“Do you know them personally?” asked Captain
Link.</p>

<p>“Oh yes; that portly, good-looking gentleman,
speaking to the aeronaut, is Sir Joseph Terry, J.P.,
four times Lord Mayor of York; next to him is Sir
William Ingram, Bart. The other gentlemen are
Mr T. Hanson Lewis, a barrister, Mr John Holah,
an artist, and Mr Charles Bucknell, an amateur
aeronaut. The other aeronauts are Mr T. Wright,
Mr Beatson, of Huddersfield, and the Brothers
Spencer, of Holloway.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” said the captain; “and
now just one more inquiry, who is that tall, inquisitive
looking man?—I have seen him before, eyeing
me rather attentively.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“Oh, never mind him—you would not care for his
acquaintance,” said the official with a smile, as
Hawksworth moved aside.</p>

<p>Miss Chain thought so too, though she refrained
from mentioning his name, when they drew near
the enclosure.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>REMARKABLE EVENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> Captain Link had been enjoying his saunter
with Miss Chain, Harry Goodall had been engaged
with Trigger and the men in completing the inflation,
which had progressed rapidly; yet, somehow, the
assistant was not feeling easy, as his master had been
sent for and detained in the building, and Miss Chain
had not come back as she promised. Besides, he had
been told that she had been seen strolling about with
a gentleman who had the appearance of an officer, and
Tom, who took a lively interest in Miss Chain’s welfare,
felt vexed at her being so long absent with a
stranger; and on Mr Goodall’s return, Trigger candidly
told his master what he had heard. Mr Goodall
was very sorry, for he feared that perhaps his joking
question to Captain Link as to where marriages were
made, when they were strolling about, had been overheard
and had given rise to gossip. Possibly that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
man Hawksworth had been ensconced in the shrubs
while they were chatting.</p>

<p>Presently, however, Captain Link, Miss Chain and
her mother entered the inner circle, and Tom was
thoroughly restored to good humour by their return.
Soon afterwards Tom was called aside by Hawksworth,
who said in an undertone, but with confidence,—</p>

<p>“I felt sure that I was right in sticking here with
you and Mr Goodall—and how like his photo this
pretended captain is.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know in the least what you are driving
at,” cried Trigger.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Mr Goodall, who had overheard the
remark, “I fear you are labouring under a delusion.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Simon Warner, coming forward, “you
are wrong this time, Jack!”</p>

<p>“Not I,” persisted Hawksworth, who, taking a
photo from his pocket and then quietly going up to
Captain Link, requested him to withdraw, and to
consider himself under arrest.</p>

<p>“What do I hear? You scoundrel!—under arrest!”
cried Captain Link. “If you don’t immediately retract
your words and apologise, I will knock you down.”</p>

<p>“Go it, captain!” cried a bystander.</p>

<p>Then a great stir and excitement arose, but Simon
Warner stepping between the enraged captain and
Hawksworth, whispered to the detective,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“You are on the wrong tack. I have seen the
man you want and his mate, too. I mean that little
fellow Croft—both of them have been under your
very nose of late—and now you have gone and insulted
a gentleman.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr Goodall, Tom Trigger and the
general manager had ranged up near Captain Link,
to protest against the charge, and in doing so they
attempted to allude to the farcical error, in a humorous
style, as a gross blunder on the part of the
detective, Hawksworth—who was unknown to the
authorities and who openly stated that he was extremely
sorry, but he had made a mistake, and
begged the captain’s pardon.</p>

<p>Captain Link then, in a very manly way, accepted
the altered situation and was loudly cheered by the bystanders.
But Warner, with remarkable shrewdness,
said in an undertone by way of further explanation,—</p>

<p>“The party you are in search of, Hawksworth, is
almost, though not quite, the double of that gentleman
who is Captain Link.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t he leave Sydney and arrive here in
the ship <i>Neptune</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” interrupted the aeronaut, “he has the
honour to command her. You have missed your men,
Hawksworth. The fellows you want have been knocking
about here, causing no end of mischief, for some
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“If,” said Warner, “you want to drop upon two men
named Falcon and Croft, you come along with me
and I’ll show you which road they took, though I
fear they’ve hooked it by this time.”</p>

<p>Hawksworth, after hearing this, at once withdrew
from the enclosure with Warner, when the situation
was at length comprehended by everybody present,
and Captain Link, together with the aeronaut, became
the heroes of the hour.</p>

<p>The general manager, knowing that the appointed
time for the ascent had expired, said,—</p>

<p>“Pray, Mr Goodall, do not delay the ascent any
longer, for these complications are most regrettable.”</p>

<p>“I would not hurry Mr Goodall,” said the chairman
of the directors. “I have placed at his disposal,
near the car, a small hamper of refreshments, which
may be acceptable to them on their journey,” he added.</p>

<p>After acknowledging this thoughtful attention, Mr
Goodall and his party took their places in the car,
Trigger having already tested the ascending power
with the gardeners’ help, who put in the car plenty of
ballast. All being ready, the aeronaut released his
balloon. Immediately an encouraging cheer arose,
and all eyes were directed to them for some
minutes.</p>

<p>The course of the voyagers was towards Essex,
but the balloon was soon lost to view amongst the
clouds, and was not seen afterwards from Sydenham.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
But, in following them, the reader should know that,
before they glided through into the serene upper
air, Harry Goodall was seen by his companions to
be examining more carefully his map and barometer.
Having done so, his attention was directed some few
miles ahead, as they had crossed the Thames and
were well over, when he said to his nautical friend,—</p>

<p>“Just take a look through my glass, Captain Link,
and scan that red brick building nestling among the
trees yonder.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! Goodall, that looks uncommonly like
your uncle’s residence, where I was to arrive by
train to-night, to give an account of how I had succeeded
in giving you a distaste for ballooning, and
here I am actually encouraging you and taking
part in the pursuit myself. You must really plunge
us into cloudland before the balloon is identified
through your uncle’s long-distance telescope.”</p>

<p>“Don’t alarm yourself, Link, we are parting with
ballast and shall soon be out of sight and in blue
sky, I hope, but we must watch the influence of
the north-easterly wind which prevails higher
up.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right, Harry,” said Captain Link.
“I observed the more lofty clouds going in that
direction this morning.”</p>

<p>“What a change!” exclaimed Miss Chain, “and
how much darker it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Yes,” replied the aeronaut, “we are passing
through the clouds, and I daresay you feel chilly.”</p>

<p>“Allow me,” said the captain, “to draw your
mantle closer around you, Miss Chain.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; it is certainly colder.”</p>

<p>“Eighteen degrees less than when we started,” said
Harry.</p>

<p>“But what a charming sight!” exclaimed Miss
Chain, as the balloon shot through the lighter vapour
into sunshine.</p>

<p>“Quite a sea of clouds beneath us!” said Captain
Link.</p>

<p>“Yes, and here we get a fine view of the ‘central
blue,’” cried Harry Goodall, rubbing his hands with
delight at having changed the scene.</p>

<p>But while Miss Chain and Captain Link were exchanging
their impressions as to the fantastic forms
of cloud and vapour which had gathered beneath
them, the aeronaut was intent, with his compass in
one hand, looking through an opening in the clouds
towards a point of land which he saw in the distance
partly surrounded by the sea. Goodall then noticed
the course of the balloon as indicated by the compass,
not forgetting to watch their drift over the
clouds as an additional indication of the way in
which they were going; but he was sorry to find
that, in trying to avoid his uncle’s house, they were
caught on the horns of a dilemma, for a momentary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
peep through a rift in the clouds enabled him to
perceive that they were travelling with great speed in
too close proximity to the Channel to be safe. They
had completely altered their direction, having risen
into the north-east current, which prevailed at about
a mile and a half from the earth, and they were now
going towards Hastings, and had recrossed the estuary
of the Thames without knowing it. However, Harry
Goodall did not wish to alarm Miss Chain, or to make
known their exact and rather perilous position, which
would have to be rectified.</p>

<p>Captain Link began to think that, when the chart
and the compass were so frequently consulted, there
must be some cause for uneasiness, and, as he knew
that the aeronaut had traced with a pencil on his
map their course since they left Sydenham, he asked
Harry to point out exactly where they were supposed
to be at that present moment. The aeronaut
hesitated to comply with the request, but gave the
mariner and then Tom Trigger the following answer,—</p>

<p>“We have totally changed our direction, and are
now under the sway of the north-easterly wind;—but
I am going to descend a few thousand feet and
sight the earth.”</p>

<p>“But first let me look at your latest pencil mark,
Goodall,” said Captain Link.</p>

<p>“You shall; but we are now most likely more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
within the coast line. Don’t be alarmed, Miss Chain,
I am about to make a noise with the valve by opening
it somewhat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have full confidence in your skill and
management, Mr Goodall, though I thank you for
warning me.”</p>

<p>The captain and Tom Trigger, both of whom inferred
that the balloon might have been getting
nearer to the Channel than they had been aware of,
preserved a discreet reticence; but they quite understood
that until they had passed through the widespread
range of clouds, and ascertained whether
they were over the sea or land, they could not
possibly be free from a considerable amount of doubt.
Trigger began to see to the stock of ballast which
he was in charge of,—as they were just approaching
some Alpine peaks of cloudland, and would
soon be passing down through a much denser
stratum.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Miss Chain, “it is getting
dark and damp again!”</p>

<p>“Yes; but the chill will not last long,” said Mr
Goodall, soothingly.</p>

<p>“That strong north-easter has given us a sharp
turn, Harry,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“It has, and to what extent it has driven us is just
what I am anxious to ascertain.”</p>

<p>“Strong light breaking, sir,” cried Tom Trigger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
who had taken a bag of sand in one hand while he
motioned to Captain Link to do likewise.</p>

<p>But Harry Goodall had caught the first indistinct
glance of land and water—afterwards they heard the
sound of a railway whistle—but on the left the open
sea was not far off, though the aeronaut did not point
this out, but drew Miss Chain’s attention to the green
marsh-land on their right.</p>

<p>“Yes, wonderfully green isn’t it,” replied the lady;
“but what murmuring sound is that we hear? It reminds
me of the surf breaking on the seashore!”</p>

<p>“It does resemble that, certainly,” said Captain
Link, “and we do hear the distant ripples, but we are
going rather inland.”</p>

<p>“Not so very much are we, Mr Goodall?” asked Miss
Chain, while the silence of the mariner and Trigger
was strictly and wisely preserved. “Those Martello
Towers look pretty,” she added.</p>

<p>“They will look prettier presently,” said the captain,
“as we leave them behind us. We must have
been bowling along, Harry, to be so far south?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was that swift upper current that did it;
but we are now almost in the same calm air which
prevailed when we left the Crystal Palace. At the
same time, we must land as soon as possible,” said the
aeronaut, with a knowing look which the captain
and Trigger knew how to interpret,—for there was no
disguising from them what a close shave they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
experienced, and that they were still too near the
coast line to be safe.</p>

<p>They were, however, under the influence of a
light sea breeze which bore them inland, and as a
suitable spot for alighting was descried in the distance,
Tom Trigger asked if he should be ready with the
grapnel.</p>

<p>“I think not, Trigger,” said his master. “We are
making for a nice spot behind those trees yonder;
but you may lower the trail rope, as we progress so
slowly now that the people assembled in the quarter
I am pointing to, will be able to hold us fast without
letting go the grapnel.”</p>

<p>“I had no idea, Harry,” said Captain Link, “what
tact and jockeyship were necessary in managing a
balloon. You see,” he added, turning to Miss Chain,
“the movements of this kind of craft differ widely
from those of a vessel on the water—here all is noiseless
and seemingly bewildering to novices like ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Do you think, Mr Goodall,” asked Miss Chain, “that
we shall reach the spot you have your eye upon?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; and I do not want to miss it, as the
downs beyond are uninviting—but I have no very
accurate knowledge of this part of the country. We
must stop talking, however, now, please. Pay away
your trail rope, Trigger,” added the aeronaut; “the
people there are inviting us with their cheers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>As the long rope dragged over the trees, it was
soon caught and held by the villagers and others
who had collected, and the balloon was gradually
stopped, without any order having been given to
that effect. Then the people began to pull them
down rather more hastily than pleased Mr Goodall, so
that Trigger became somewhat excited and beckoned
them not to do so until express orders were
given.</p>

<p>“Tell that stout fellow in velveteens,” said the
aeronaut, “not to be in such a hurry, and not to jerk
the rope, Trigger.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Bennet!” cried Trigger, “for one
moment, please.”</p>

<p>“How dare you call that man nicknames!” cried
Mr Goodall. “How do you know what his name is,
and who, pray, are you kissing your hand to?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, don’t you know where you are?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. Where are we, then?”</p>

<p>“Why, at Wedwell Park, in Sussex, to be sure.
There stands Lucy, sir, and Bennet, the gamekeeper.
Listen, sir, and there’s the squire, too, saying ‘Welcome
friends, pray come down.’”</p>

<p>“Confound it all!” exclaimed Harry Goodall, “I
would not have descended here on any account, if I
had known it. Link, I’m done for,” continued Goodall,
turning to the captain. “Squire Dove and his
daughter reside here. Whatever will my uncle say?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Do tell them to let go the rope, as I wish to proceed
further.”</p>

<p>“But can’t we get out of this little affair without
making an ignominious retreat, Harry?” suggested
Captain Link.</p>

<p>“It is a lovely spot!” urged Miss Chain. “What a
pity to leave it, and do notice that young lady who
appears to be anxious for us to descend, Mr Goodall.”</p>

<p>“Well, listen then, Link,” whispered Harry in a
highly nervous state, “there is only one way out
of the difficulty. <i>We must not say who we are or
where we came from.</i> Let us merely call ourselves
experimentalists who do not desire publicity—remember
that now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget, sir, that they know me,” said Trigger.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, Tom; I am very angry with
you.”</p>

<p>“There is really nothing to be frightened about,
Harry,” urged the captain. “Neither Squire Dove
nor his daughter know you personally, and as to
Trigger, you can call him the <i>balloon pilot</i>.”</p>

<p>“Bother his pilotage, and my own too! I ought to
say, however, we are all agreed not to divulge our
names.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do listen,” said Miss Chain; “they are so
anxious to have us down.”</p>

<p>“Welcome to Wedwell!” cried the squire once
more. “Do pray come down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“Yes, do come!” said Miss Dove, pleadingly.</p>

<p>“There, Harry, if you can resist that!” exclaimed
his friend Link.</p>

<p>“Yes; I suppose there is no help for it, and we
must face it, and then get away as soon as we
possibly can. Gently down,” said the aeronaut to
Trigger, “and mind you spring out when I tell you,
and warn Lucy to hold aloof and not to betray us.”</p>

<p>“She won’t do that, sir,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Gently down, Bennet,” sang out the balloon pilot,
in compliance with his master’s wish that he should
act up to his new title.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, Harry. I will make it all
right with your uncle,” whispered Captain Link, who
looked as if he were pleased at the turn things had
taken.</p>

<p>A round of cheering greeted the voyagers, as the
car dropped into the arms of the Wedwell parkites.
The squire took off his hat to Miss Chain, and Edith
Dove blushingly said some pleasant words of greeting
to Harry Goodall, who was pointed out by the
captain as the proprietor of the balloon, to whom the
chief honours were due.</p>

<p>Trigger was allowed to get out of the car, while
the sturdy gamekeeper was asked to take his place.
The aeronaut’s eyes were fixed for some seconds on
Miss Dove—but what his thoughts were neither
Captain Link nor Miss Chain could divine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“If you will only get out,” said the squire, “I will
guarantee that the gamekeeper and his men will take
charge of your balloon, whilst you all get some refreshment.
We are just going to dinner. Hand me
that chair for the lady to dismount, and do allow me,”
said the squire, “to assist you.”</p>

<p>“If one of your men will get in as each of us gets
out,” cried the aeronaut, “to make up the weight—that
will do. But the pilot is coming back; he will
tell you how to manage.”</p>

<p>“I do hope that you are not going to let the gas
out,” said the squire. “Couldn’t you, after dinner,
treat us to a captive ascent?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said the aeronaut, “I shall have much
pleasure in doing so, Squire Dove.”</p>

<p>A surly-looking old gentleman here came forward
and said,—</p>

<p>“Don’t risk your life in such a trap as that,
squire.”</p>

<p>“Please not to interfere, Doctor Peters,” retorted
Squire Dove, testily.</p>

<p>At this moment the gong was heard in the distance,
when the squire offered his arm to Miss Chain, and
begged that the aeronaut would escort Miss Dove.</p>

<p>“We must not lose sight of your nautical-looking
friend,” said the squire, alluding to Captain Link.
“Your pilot I have seen before, I believe; he will be
in good hands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“Thank you, squire, he will have to stick to the
ship.”</p>

<p>“Now, do favour me with your name,” said the
Squire to the aeronaut.</p>

<p>“The truth is we have all agreed to preserve strict
secrecy in that respect, squire, for reasons which I
cannot fully explain just at this moment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I quite grasp the idea. You are not professional
balloonists, probably, and do not wish to
make known what you are doing.”</p>

<p>“No, we are not, and do not care about publicity or
anything of that sort.”</p>

<p>“I observed that, after you came through the clouds,
your balloon moved less rapidly, and just as it came
nearer the earth you were almost becalmed—how do
you account for that, pray?”</p>

<p>“I scarcely know,” replied the aeronaut; “it may
have been owing to some influence I failed to notice.”</p>

<p>“Atmospheric, you mean,” cried the squire.</p>

<p>“Oh, do, papa,” interposed Miss Dove, “let us get
into the Hall before the tiresome old doctor comes.
He is following us with a letter in his hand.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps our Sydenham friend will not be in to
dinner after all,” said the squire. “We will halt for
one moment, please, to hear about that. How now,
Doctor Peters?” added the squire; “you move as
nimbly as ever.”</p>

<p>“I have just had a message, squire,” said the doctor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
in a whisper, “to say that our friend Falcon cannot
keep his engagement—he may be here this evening
or to-morrow. Excuse my coming in, squire.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, certainly, Peters, you amuse yourself
with the balloon. Did our friend Falcon come down
to Lewes?”</p>

<p>“I did not hear particulars,” replied the doctor;
“but something has turned up to stop his arrival
here.”</p>

<p>“No accident, I hope?” said Miss Dove.</p>

<p>“Now do come in, friends,” urged the squire, who
proceeded to show his visitors above stairs.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when they were seated at table, the
squire expressed regret that his friend, who had not
been in England long, did not happen to be present.</p>

<p>“Very likely, Edith,” said her father, “he was detained
by something unforeseen at Sydenham.”</p>

<p>“It may have been owing to something <i>seen</i>,” said
Miss Dove, archly.</p>

<p>But while the squire’s daughter looked as if it
would be quite as well for them to say no more about
the absentee, the aeronaut caught sight of an enlarged
photographic likeness, on which his attention was
riveted, and which appeared to give him some uneasiness,
but it passed unnoticed by Miss Chain and
Captain Link, their backs being towards it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>UNMASKED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> secret thoughts of Harry Goodall, Captain Link
and Miss Chain, whilst at dinner, were of a varied
character. The aeronaut’s were of a surprised and
bewildered kind, his friend Link’s of a cheerful
description, and Miss Chain’s of a mixed and somewhat
melancholy order, for she felt sorry for her
employer, who had been suddenly and unexpectedly
thrown among people whom he had been studiously
neglecting, and who would not probably be so genial
had they known who he was. Miss Chain was hopeful,
however, that Miss Dove would dispel the
aeronaut’s reserve, for she was trying to make him
feel at home, and was unquestionably proving attractive
to him. Even the squire thought that he had
never seen his daughter so animated and captivating
before. Captain Link was sure that Harry’s visit
could not possibly have a bad effect, for his excellent
qualities would soon be appreciated; nor was he slow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
to perceive that, if the Doves’ expected friend turned
out to be Falcon, the man whom he had seen that
morning with his confederate Croft, it would prove
to be no ill wind that had blown them to Wedwell
Park, so that the captain inwardly exulted in the
idea that their rather risky cruise would turn out to
be the luckiest he had ever made, as Mr William
Goodall had assured him that, if he could only persuade
his nephew to go to Wedwell either by rail
or road, he would be booked for promotion, though
of course, it never entered the merchant’s mind that
Harry would ever present himself there in his balloon,
much less that he would do so in Captain Link’s
company, who had been afraid of their hovering over
Essex, and had very likely been the cause of the
balloon wandering into Sussex, and which by a fluke
dropped among the Doves of Wedwell Park.</p>

<p>Miss Dove, meanwhile, seemed to be more and more
taken with the aeronaut’s unpretending manners, and
to be listening intently to his excellent conversation.</p>

<p>Captain Link, who was delighted with Miss Chain’s
intelligent remarks and lady-like manners, knew that,
but for the fortunate circumstance of having been
introduced to her by Goodall, he would not have
been where he was, so that he had to hide his good
spirits lest they should present too great a contrast
to his friend’s somewhat depressed manner, which
had been noticed by the squire, so he ordered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
servant to replenish the gentleman’s wine glass by
way of cheering up the man of science; and the host,
moreover, asked for his opinion as to the wonderful
statements which had recently appeared as to “Flying
being made Easy” and “Aerial Navies grappling
in the Central Blue.”</p>

<p>Thus challenged, the aeronaut’s eyes brightened
considerably; he seemed, however, as if he were reluctant
to give full play to what he really thought,
though it was clear that he had sentiments of his
own which he was capable of imparting if he were
so disposed.</p>

<p>The squire’s daughter seeing this, and being
determined to draw him out if possible, said,—</p>

<p>“I hope the day will never come when the
anarchists will use these scientific appliances to pour
down upon the people’s heads tons of fire and flame
in the dreadful way we have read about.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said the aeronaut, “I think it much
more probable that the constituted authorities may
turn upon the heads of the anarchists some kind of
check in that form—that is, if ever they combine in
such an immense array that the latest types of guns
cannot disperse them, as Maxim’s guns did the hordes
of Matabeleland.”</p>

<p>“What do you say to that, sir?” asked the squire
of his nautical visitor.</p>

<p>“I quite agree with the aeronaut,” replied the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
mariner; “and I may mention,” continued he, “that
balloons, and parachutes as well, have only recently
been proposed for use by my friend to illustrate how
applicable they are for such purposes in proper hands,
and he has shown that they can be advantageously
employed without waiting for the aid of flying
machines and directable aerostats, which have been
so long promised, and yet I doubt, if the sum of
£10,000 were offered to any man who could unmistakably
demonstrate ‘flight’ before a committee
of reliable men, that there would be found anyone
able to entitle himself to it!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the squire, “that would be a fair
enough way of settling these pretensions.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you believe, Miss Dove,” added the
aeronaut, “that the continental military balloonists
can direct their air ships so that those anarchical
foreigners can bombard our coasts, cities and towns
with dynamite in the way they propose?”</p>

<p>“You do not think, then, that flying is to be so
easily accomplished?”</p>

<p>“Not just yet. Futile attempts may be made, and
many narrow escapes recorded.”</p>

<p>“But couldn’t aerial navies from the Continent
come to our shores?”</p>

<p>“Of course they can, but not by the novel style
of flying which is talked about. No, Miss Dove,
if men or machines can fly, the inventors of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
need not wait for war to make their fortunes.
Merchants and capitalists would find it to their
advantage to handsomely remunerate such persons to
use their wings for mercantile and other purposes—of
course men will embark in Quixotic performances.”</p>

<p>“But if they do not succeed,” said the squire, “it
must heavily handicap and tax poor inventors to pay
for their schemes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, they always did pay for them; but
I daresay you are aware, squire, that syndicates and
benevolent capitalists might be found to assist bold
and incautious financiers to float them.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, my dear sir?” asked the squire.
“You are awakening—that is, enlightening us surprisingly;
but do let us fill up our glasses—one almost
requires a stimulant to face even the thought of what
may be going on in these times. I only heard yesterday
of a suicidal attempt at flying that came off at
Haywards Heath by some foreigners.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Edith Dove, “you do not believe in all
these wonderful modern experiments?”</p>

<p>“Not in some of them. A few scientific inventors
of recent date may be sanguine, clever and well-intentioned
men, but not all of them, I fear.”</p>

<p>“How pleased, Edith,” said her father, “Mr Falcon
would be to take part in these discussions. What a
pity he is not here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“The doctor thought he might arrive later, papa,
and so he may be here yet.”</p>

<p>“Our friend Falcon,” said the squire, “has been a
great traveller, and represents a firm of shipowners
in London and Sydney.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, the squire did not observe that his
reference to Mr Falcon fell like a bomb-shell among
his guests, who controlled, as far as possible, any outward
indication of their feelings, though they knew
who was meant by the squire in his last utterance,
and as the aeronaut had been looking at Falcon’s
photo on the wall, he was not in reality so much
taken by surprise as were Miss Chain and Captain
Link.</p>

<p>“These gentlemen may possibly have met Mr
Falcon, Edith,” said the squire.</p>

<p>“May I ask if that is his portrait?” asked the
aeronaut of Miss Dove, pointing to the photo on the
wall.</p>

<p>“Yes! you have been studying the face, haven’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I know the face, but I am not very familiar with
the name,” replied the aeronaut.</p>

<p>“I should think, Edith, that this gentleman,” turning
to the mariner, “is the more likely to know Mr
Falcon,” said her father.</p>

<p>“I certainly know a Mr Falcon,” replied the captain,
“and I’ll have a look at his likeness presently.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“And the young lady,” said Miss Dove, “is she at
all acquainted with him?”</p>

<p>“I have seen the shadow of <i>a</i> Mr Falcon, but the
person I have such vivid recollections of was named,
I think, Filcher Falcon, and may, or may not, be the
same man,” replied Miss Chain.</p>

<p>“Did you mind the name Filcher, Edith?” asked
the squire. “We may, after all,” he continued, “be
alluding to two distinct persons.”</p>

<p>At this point, Miss Dove gave her father a look
which he appeared to understand, for the financier
was not, for a time, further mentioned.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Chain had not yet seen whether the likeness
on the wall, and the “shadow man” represented
one and the same person, but she strongly suspected
that it was so, though she and the captain suppressed
their curiosity for a while, but they had their misgivings;
and as to the squire and his daughter, they
both saw that they had been treading upon dangerous
ground, and that the mystery could not very well be
cleared up just then, so by way of changing the subject,
Squire Dove asked the aeronaut if he intended
dropping in Wedwell Park.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I came to you, more from necessity
than desire,” was the candid reply. “We were
advancing towards the sea, after having journeyed
by a strong upper current over the clouds from
Essex, when your property, squire, was found to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
be the most suitable and tempting spot on which
to alight.”</p>

<p>“Then what induced you to hesitate, if I may take
the liberty of asking, before you at length condescended
to drop among us?”</p>

<p>“We were divided in opinion as to the advisability
of coming down; but your persuasive invitation,
coupled with Miss Dove’s appeal, decided me to do
so, though I certainly doubted whether ballooning
would be acceptable to you.”</p>

<p>“I hope,” said Miss Dove, “that Doctor Peters’s
rude remark did not give offence.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” added the squire. “He is an obstinate
man, but I was not aware that he felt a prejudice
against aerial research.”</p>

<p>“It may be,” said the aeronaut, “that he is in
the confidence of the gentleman whose photo faces
me.”</p>

<p>“Umph!” thought the captain, “Harry is fizzing
like a bottle of champagne in his balloon car.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the squire, “Doctor Peters and our
expected visitor may or may not entertain similar
views, but I never heard them allude to aerostatics
or balloonists.”</p>

<p>“No doubt, papa,” said Miss Dove, “that this pleasant
and instructive visit will enlighten us a good deal.”</p>

<p>“I do believe it will, my dear,” said her father,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“I wish,” said Miss Dove, “that we could address
our friends by their names. May we, however,” turning
towards the mariner, “venture to beg of the—captain,
to tell us how he and the lady liked their
voyage?”</p>

<p>Captain Link having bowed in recognition of Miss
Dove’s guess as to his rank proceeded to state that,
although he had often crossed the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans, besides having been round the world
more than once, yet he had not, until that day, ever
been up in a balloon, nor had the young lady, whose
acquaintance he had but recently made in a most
romantic manner, in fact, they were both much indebted
to the aeronaut for their first aerial journey,
but seeing the aeronaut frowning at this injudicious
communication, he must beg to be excused from
saying anything further.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” cried Miss Dove, “that is too bad, captain—why,
your story was just becoming so interesting.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, you will vastly disappoint us, captain,
unless you proceed,” said the squire. “We are on
the tiptoe of expectation to profit by every word
that either of you might utter.”</p>

<p>“Besides, we may never have another chance,
papa!” said Miss Dove, anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, for such visits may be, like angels’,
few and far between, so you <i>must finish up</i>,
captain,” cried the squire, “for I tell you candidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
that we are already under a spell. All that you
say leads us to regard you as aerial messengers with
the best of intentions, telling us something for our
good. I beg of you to continue.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, if I must do so, I may as well tell
you that this young lady had been acquainted with a
gentleman who was not of the ancient knightly order;
on the contrary, he had been most heartless, unfair and
cruel to her, so that, when my friend there told me of
the way the said gentleman had behaved, I felt as if
I should like to take up the cudgels for the injured
one, and while thinking so, he most unexpectedly
turned up but made off immediately afterwards, and
well he did so, for an officious detective was after
him. Now, would you believe it, not so many hours
ago, this so-called astute officer suddenly attempted
to arrest me, believing that I was this suspected
person—whose name I need not mention.”</p>

<p>“Are you listening, Edith? Pay attention. There
might have been some personal resemblance. The
captain admits that,” said Squire Dove.</p>

<p>“I am so intent, papa, on what the captain is
telling us, that I can barely answer. I have not
lost a word; but,” she added turning to the captain,
“do please go on, your experience is so very interesting.”</p>

<p>“The detective soon found out his mistake and
was taken to task about it. It was an amusing scene,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
continued the captain, “for I was on the point of
figuring as a belligerent, but my friend stopped me
from committing myself.”</p>

<p>“Was it not that honest policeman, captain, who
did so?” interrupted the aeronaut.</p>

<p>“So it was; he acted a good part, and will be a
great man some day.”</p>

<p>“What was his name?” asked the squire.</p>

<p>“We must not tell names, according to our agreement,”
said the captain, laughingly.</p>

<p>“How trying!” said the squire.</p>

<p>“Oh, you might just tell us the policeman’s name
and the locality,” said Miss Dove, persuasively, and
the captain was half-inclined to do so, when a servant
knocked at the door and handed a note to
Miss Dove.</p>

<p>“Won’t it be as well,” said the squire, taking out
his watch, “to go and see about a captive ascent?
You must not think of leaving us to-night, friends,
for, to be candid with you, neither I nor my daughter
can rest until we know more of you, and hear the
sequel to your adventure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Miss Dove, “we can now very
easily understand why you didn’t wish names to be
known.”</p>

<p>“We will talk that over after the ascents,” said
the squire. “I daresay my gamekeeper, who is outside,
wants to know if we are ready to ascend. Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Dove will take your lady friend upstairs; but, dear
me, she is looking at the photograph of Mr Falcon,
and has turned quite pale. Do take her to your
room, Edith, and don’t forget to give orders about
the other rooms for our friends. And now, gentlemen,”
added the squire, “do be seated for five minutes
and taste my port wine. Here’s health and long
life to you both. Ah! I’m truly glad to find that
we are brothers in a masonic sense. It strikes me
that I shall know your names before long, and those
other two names as well. I mean of the unprincipled
gentleman and the able policeman.”</p>

<p>“We shall feel bound to let you know them before
we separate,” said the aeronaut.</p>

<p>“I have just been thinking,” observed Squire Dove,
“that there is something very remarkable in your
having all identified the photographic likeness on
the wall. Three to one is long odds. I suppose, if
Mr Falcon should come in, you will have no objection
to meeting him?”</p>

<p>“I should not,” said the aeronaut.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” added the captain, “if I am not again mistaken
for him by a detective as I was this morning.”</p>

<p>“You are letting the cat out of the bag now,
captain,” said the squire. “But really I thought
you were alluding to our Mr Falcon in your humorous
story, that is to say if you were not indulging
in fiction.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“What I said was all literally true, squire.”</p>

<p>“I can answer for that,” added the aeronaut.</p>

<p>“You amaze me completely,” cried the squire; “but
would you, if Mr Falcon should turn up outside or
here, tell him so to his face?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a great deal more,” replied Captain Link;
“but Falcon would not have the audacity to remain
for a second in our presence.”</p>

<p>“That is saying a good deal! And I begin to
think he will not come this evening, as he would
perhaps hear that your balloon had come down here.
I believe, candidly, gentlemen, that every word you
have said must have some foundation; but I am very
vexed to suppose that I have been deceived in this
man, for I took him for a great and successful financier.
However, we can enter into these points by-and-by,
as I daresay there are many friends and
neighbours in the park by this time. Mr Falcon may
be in their midst, for all I know.”</p>

<p>“He is more likely to be in ambush not far off,”
said the aeronaut.</p>

<p>“Indeed! you speak, my friends, with such an air
of confidence, that I shall not hesitate to suggest
that we start down at once and inquire if anything
has been seen or heard of him. Someone is knocking,
I think,” added the squire. “Oh, Lucy, come in.
What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“If you please, sir, Miss Dove says that, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
young lady is not very well, she would like to remain
with her a little longer, but she wishes that
the gentlemen should not delay their captive ascents,
although there will be moonlight early this evening.
And Miss Dove wishes you to read this short telegram,
sir—just received.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Lucy, then we will go down to the
park at once, and say I hope the lady will soon
be herself again.”</p>

<p>After Lucy had left the room, the squire read the
short note.</p>

<p>“It is merely a hoax, I should say,” added the
squire, “but judge for yourselves. This is what it
says,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Miss Dove is warned to be careful how she walks
about Wedwell Park and other parts for the next
few days, without she has someone with her.</p>

<p class="right">“‘S. W.’</p>
</div>

<p>“There is no signature attached,” added the squire,
“beyond the initials S. W.; they do not amount to
much. S. W. might be Sam Watson, an officious
neighbour.”</p>

<p>“Or Simon Warner,” thought the aeronaut, and
then turning to the squire, he said,—</p>

<p>“Will you allow me just to see the handwriting?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t know it,” replied the squire; “it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
a telegram, remember. Still, Falcon’s absence, if persisted
in, will give rise to fears which will be greatly
increased if he does not show up by to-morrow;
his not coming to-day, when he faithfully appointed
to be here to dinner, attaches great weight to what
you have all three said.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” replied the aeronaut, as he looked
at the captain, “that we have done wrong in not
going farther a-field, as we are creating unpleasant
apprehensions.”</p>

<p>“Your opportune arrival here, on the contrary,
may prove of the utmost service to me and to my
daughter; and now, after that frank admission, we
must really be moving towards the balloon; but
before we leave, I will just ask Bennet to step
in.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard anything, Bennet, about that
silly attempt at flight near Haywards Heath?”</p>

<p>“Not much in it, squire, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Who were the parties?”</p>

<p>“Two Dutchmen, I was told. The man who tried to
fly was a little man called Professor Scudder, and
his employer, I heard, was a fine, big, full-bearded
gentleman, but his beard and wig were false.”</p>

<p>“How could they know that, Bennet?”</p>

<p>“There was an explosion, squire, and he was blown
into a horse pond, where his wig and beard came
off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“What next shall we hear of? Quite a mountebank
performance, I suppose,” said the squire, with a loud
laugh.</p>

<p>“Something that way. It was thought, squire,
Professor Scudder was shot into a clump of trees,
and had a narrow escape.”</p>

<p>“May I ask your gamekeeper how long since this
affair came off?” asked the aeronaut.</p>

<p>“Barely a fortnight since, sir,” said Bennet.</p>

<p>“Soon after I alighted on the Essex Marsh,”
observed Harry Goodall to Captain Link, suggestively.</p>

<small>THE MYSTERIOUS SHOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Now</span>, Bennet,” said the squire, as they left the
hall, “will the balloon lift us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, squire, the pilot says she has plenty of
power.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I ought to have told you, gentlemen,
that we have large works near the park lane
which can supply more gas if it is required. How
much can we spare, Bennet?”</p>

<p>“About 20,000 feet, squire—that is, on demand,
but much more to order.”</p>

<p>“We are surprised to hear this, squire,” said the
aeronaut; “at that rate, my balloon could be either
refilled here, or fed and retained if need be.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it could. I hope the pilot has been well
seen after, Bennet?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, squire, I have attended to him myself;
but we have been a bit annoyed by the doctor, who
has been taking on worse than ever.”</p>

<p>“What about? What has he to do with my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
visitors, who have enlightened me on points of great
importance, and who will always meet with a warm
reception here?”</p>

<p>“Doctor Peters has been predicting, squire, that
the balloon is like a bird of ill omen, and that it
means something unpleasant happening.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he meant it portends that something
unpleasant has been found out. However, I must
clip the doctor’s wings, and as to ‘birds of ill omen,’
I don’t know whom he can be thinking about. By-the-bye,
have you seen anything of Mr Falcon?”</p>

<p>“Not to-day, squire.”</p>

<p>“When was his servant, Croft, last here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not since Mr Falcon was injured in the back
by the Essex poachers, squire.”</p>

<p>A hearty laugh followed this remark, but the
aeronaut did not venture a reply until the squire
said,—</p>

<p>“What do you think of that, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the sportsman was on other people’s
property,” said Harry Goodall.</p>

<p>“That is a question we will leave for the present,”
replied the squire.</p>

<p>“Is Doctor Peters still in the park, Bennet?”</p>

<p>“I believe he has gone to the post-office, squire,
about an answer to a telegram he sent to Sydenham
when the balloon arrived.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it, is it? Well, the doctor may be on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
the staff of the <i>Times</i> for what I know; he is a
most singular character. One can scarcely take
seriously all that he has to say of himself. But
you go on in advance, Bennet, and say that we are
on our way down.”</p>

<p>“What may be your pilot’s name, pray?” asked
Squire Dove.</p>

<p>“Tom Trigger,” replied the aeronaut.</p>

<p>“An expressive name. Is he a good shot?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean at game, squire?” asked the aeronaut,
smiling.</p>

<p>“It is not to be supposed that he would fire on a
fellow-creature.”</p>

<p>“Yet he has fired at one when greatly exasperated,”
said the aeronaut.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” exclaimed the squire, as they rounded
a clump of lofty trees in the vicinity of a fish-pond,
near to which the gas house was located, close to a
lane.</p>

<p>“Now, pilot,” said the aeronaut, “will the balloon
lift three, including Squire Dove?”</p>

<p>“She has ample power, sir, for four.”</p>

<p>“My daughter will not be able to join us just yet,”
added the squire. “Can the balloon ascend by moonlight?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied the aeronaut.</p>

<p>On the strength of these assurances, the squire,
Harry Goodall and the captain ascended to the length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
of a long rope, and had a splendid bird’s-eye view of
the park and the surrounding country. Afterwards, at
the squire’s request, his neighbour, the Reverend Mr
Penfold went up, the squire accompanying him. This
induced many others to follow, and after a time some
of the household went aloft, conducted by Tom Trigger,
Lucy having set them the example, but she had to
go back immediately afterwards to Miss Dove, who
was soon going down for her moonlight trip; but the
squire began to think that it was almost too late to
continue the ascents. However, as Miss Dove was
seen to be approaching in the carriage, he said,—</p>

<p>“Can you take the captain besides yourself and my
daughter?” adding that he would himself see to the
working of the windlass.</p>

<p>As soon as they were comfortably seated, the
aeronaut said,—</p>

<p>“Let up steadily, please, squire.”</p>

<p>“All right, the pilot and plenty of hands are in
attendance.”</p>

<p>The view Miss Dove had of the park and Wedwell
Hall by the light of the moon was unexpectedly
gratifying, but owing to the lady visitor’s attack of
hysteria, Edith was more thoughtful and less appreciative
of the silvery-lighted scenery than she otherwise
would have been; still, her remarks of delight
were heard below, and her friends declared that this
was the most striking ascent that had been made,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
for the people cheered and gave Miss Dove quite an
ovation. But just when the pilot and Bennet had
commenced to wind down the balloon, a report from
a gun was heard, which appeared to have been discharged
from a neighbouring plantation—and as the
flash was seen just within the borders of the plantation,
people hardly knew what to make of the affair,
especially as a hat was seen directly afterwards to
fall from the balloon.</p>

<p>Bennet, thinking that it was the accidental discharge
of a poacher’s gun, rushed up a bye-path
leading to the lane, followed by a local policeman
and a stranger, who had not long arrived from Lewes,
and who was said to be a detective named Warner.</p>

<p>As the balloon came near the ground, something
was seen to be wrong, for Miss Dove appeared very
excited, and the aeronaut had drawn a scarf over his
head; but he asked the squire to help Miss Dove out
of the car, when she stepped aside and whispered
something to her father. The captain, looking very
serious, told Trigger to place some men in the car, as
they got out, then he offered to assist the aeronaut to
dismount, but the aeronaut said, as if nothing was
amiss, that he did not want any help, though the
squire and Miss Dove, who had now reappeared, could
perceive that blood was flowing down his face.</p>

<p>“Do, papa,” cried the anxious young lady, “insist
upon his going up to the Hall with us in the carriage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“Yes, take my arm and do so,” said the squire;
“and you accompany us, captain.”</p>

<p>Trigger followed them to the door of the carriage,
having his master’s hat in his hand, and pointed to a
hole in it; but the aeronaut smiled and said,—</p>

<p>“You are really making much ado about nothing;
it is a mere graze on the head. Don’t, pray, feel
alarmed.”</p>

<p>Miss Dove, despite these assurances, was visibly
agitated, nor could she well be otherwise, as a rather
copious flow of blood pointed to a wound of some
kind.</p>

<p>As soon as the Hall was reached, Lucy was sent for
to go and look for Doctor Peters. She came forward,
looking very frightened and saying that the cook,
Saunders, had met with some injury, for Lucy had
not yet seen who was in the carriage, and was going
on to explain the cook’s mishap, when the aeronaut,
her former master, entered. Seeing that some
accident had happened, Lucy ran off at once, followed
by the squire, to obtain the doctor’s assistance, whilst
the captain, having got some water and a sponge,
began to bathe the wound, and was doing his best to
stop the bleeding when the doctor was heard to be
coming with the squire.</p>

<p>Doctor Peters was astonished to see who was his
second patient, and was inclined to break out into a
tirade as to the two disasters which had been brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
about by the balloon. He said the cook had been
knocked down by two fellows, and now what was
this affair?</p>

<p>The squire, though he had hardly patience to explain,
said,—</p>

<p>“While my daughter was making a captive ascent,
someone fired off a gun at this gentleman or at Edith,
from the long plantation!”</p>

<p>The doctor, who had not examined the wound with
much energy, suggested that it might have been accidental,
most likely a stray shot from a poacher’s
gun—judging by the partially scalping effects
of it.</p>

<p>“Is it at all serious?” asked the squire, impatiently.</p>

<p>“I should say not, squire. The cranium has been
struck over the phrenological organ of benevolence.
Had it been an inch lower, it might have proved fatal.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Miss Dove, “it is not dangerous?”</p>

<p>“No, it is of a superficial character, fortunately.”</p>

<p>“It is a pity,” said Miss Dove, as she left the room to
go and speak to the invalid lady upstairs, “that you
did not say so at once.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Your misplaced formality, doctor, is perplexing
and uncalled for,” said the irritated squire,
“and I think that if you had come to the point at
once it would have been quite as well.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, squire,” said the patient. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
told you before that nothing very serious had
occurred.”</p>

<p>“Then if I go and see to the ladies, you will excuse
me for a short time,” said the squire.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said the aeronaut; “and I shall feel
obliged if the captain will go down to the people and
give Doctor Peters’s report to all who may inquire
after Miss Dove and myself.”</p>

<p>“My dear sir!” exclaimed the doctor, as the
captain left, “excuse me, but I noticed that you
coupled your name in a very familiar manner with
Miss Dove’s. Now, perhaps you are not aware that a
gentleman has been assiduously and recently—”</p>

<p>“There, shut up your confounded nonsense, doctor,”
cried the aeronaut, with a loud laugh; “I am quite sure
that no one who may have been visiting here lately,
or who may still be hanging about this neighbourhood,
will have any chance with Miss Dove unless his intentions
and actions are honourable.”</p>

<p>“My good sir,” cried the doctor, “your wound is
causing an inflammatory state of the brain, I am afraid.
Do be less wandering if you can, or I cannot undertake
to fit you for leaving here, as you no doubt wish
to do, in order to attend to your ballooning. If you
keep quiet, you can leave with my approval to-morrow;
but to do so you must avoid all flights of
fancy that may prove exciting.”</p>

<p>Here the patient broke out into another fit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
laughter, which brought down Miss Dove, who was
delighted to hear any indication of cheerfulness.</p>

<p>“I was simply alluding,” said Doctor Peters, by way
of explanation, “to Mr Falcon’s visits here, when this
gentleman thought proper to betray feverish, if not
slighting, outbursts, which I was not prepared for,
Miss Dove.”</p>

<p>“Have you noticed, Doctor Peters,” asked Edith,
“that my father has removed Mr Falcon’s portrait?”</p>

<p>“No, I had not, Miss Dove,” said the doctor; “in
fact, I have been feeling partially bewildered ever
since the balloonists dropped upon us, so you must
not be too hard on an old friend.”</p>

<p>After this appeal, Edith left the doctor and his
patient alone.</p>

<p>“Did I understand,” asked the doctor, “that you
knew Mr Falcon?”</p>

<p>“I have seen him on more occasions than one,”
replied the patient. “Hadn’t he been shot in the
back, and didn’t he try to wear spectacles, and hasn’t
he a rather flighty turn?”</p>

<p>“What can you know of Mr Falcon’s habits
beyond mere hearsay?”</p>

<p>“I know more about him than you imagine,
doctor!”</p>

<p>“Of his double, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“I am alluding to your Mr Falcon, who wore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
spectacles on the day that he was shot at in the
Essex marshes for attempted incendiarism.”</p>

<p>“Merciful powers! My good sir, what are you
dreaming of? He certainly did tell me that he had
tried spectacles, but I told him to throw them up.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you what else he had tried?”</p>

<p>“God bless me, sir, you are getting worse and
worse.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen him about here this evening,
doctor? I mean since you communicated with
him?”</p>

<p>“Goodness me, no! It would be impossible for
Mr Falcon to be here.”</p>

<p>“How so? Supposing he left Sydenham Station
before five o’clock, couldn’t he have secretly crept
into the park before the last ascent of the balloon?”</p>

<p>“My good man!” cried the doctor, “you have got
some of the most horrible notions in your head that
it is possible to conceive.”</p>

<p>“Would you, doctor, be surprised to learn, as I did
before I was shot at, that a policeman from Sydenham
is now here watching the proceedings?”</p>

<p>“I must really go and have a private talk with
the squire, and send for your friend. Ah! some
knocks—come in. Oh! it’s Miss Dove, I see. Will
you remain here, Miss Edith, while I speak with
your father?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, doctor; you will meet him coming down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>When Doctor Peters met the squire, he said to him
confidentially,—</p>

<p>“It is advisable that the balloonist’s friend, the
sailor, should look well after him to-night; and he
must take no stimulants, as I fear that his mind is
affected.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so, Peters?”</p>

<p>“Think so? I’m sure of it, squire. He fancies that
your friend Falcon is an incendiary and a homicide,
besides being flighty.”</p>

<p>“That is no proof that he is deranged; this
scientific gentleman is a perfectly sane and far-seeing
man.”</p>

<p>“Is he, squire? Then I am wrong in the upper
story myself, while you are far gone in balloonacy!
But don’t you listen to any cleverly-devised fables
without having strong evidence to support them,
squire, for I have no doubt that Mr Falcon will reappear
to-morrow or next day and upset these
people’s statements.”</p>

<p>“He dare not appear face to face with them,” said
the squire.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe that, for it is only the
balloonist’s wild notion, which he has got into his
head to-night.”</p>

<p>“It is well he didn’t get the bullet into his head!
The question now for solution is, who fired either at
him or at my daughter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“I am surprised, Squire Dove, at your having
listened to what these utter strangers have insinuated
about an absent man, who is being very
likely mistaken for someone else of the same name.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know, doctor, what these strangers
have told me and my daughter?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not, but if I had been present when
they disparaged Mr Falcon, I should have stood up
for him, as I will do until he arrives to defend himself;
and as you have always been credited, squire,
with not being prejudiced against the accused until
you hear what he has to say, I hope you will not
be hasty in believing all you hear.”</p>

<p>“When we get strong confirmation—proof after
proof against Falcon, I suppose you will give in
then, doctor?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, squire, I will undertake to eat my own
words if you can convince me that I am wrong, for I
look upon this episode in ballooning as a farcical
affair!”</p>

<p>“That will do, doctor, please, for it may sooner
than you expect present a much more serious aspect!
Of course, you will give your patients a look in the
morning?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly. I have well dressed the balloonist’s
head.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fear, doctor, that he will turn out ungrateful,
for if one-half of what I hear is true, he may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
return the compliment before long by giving you a
dressing.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to see you influenced, squire, by such
absurd trash. Don’t believe a word of it. <i>Au revoir.</i>”</p>

<p>When the squire hastened down the park to see
if the man who had discharged the gun had been
seen, he found that the local policeman and Bennet
had not yet returned from their chase after the
two men from the back part of Wedwell Hall, who
had been seen to run away in a northerly direction,
where they might have met and injured the cook.</p>

<p>Just before the aeronaut had gone aloft for the
last trip, Warner had suddenly appeared on the scene,
though not expected, but he had not sufficient time
to tell Mr Goodall the object of his visit. Thinking
it, therefore, just possible that he might not see the
aeronaut again for some little time to describe what
brought him down to Wedwell Park, he went into
the gamekeeper’s cottage and wrote down on a slip
of paper a memorandum of particulars and left the
same for early delivery to Mr Goodall.</p>

<p>The captain brought it up to the Hall, accompanied
by the squire, after they had seen that the pilot,
together with a good staff of workmen had been told
off to look after the balloon during the night.</p>

<p>The squire, who had inadvertently or purposely
left the young people alone, anxiously asked if the
patient was worse?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“No, I am altogether better, squire,” said the
aeronaut, and glancing at the letter which the captain
handed him, he gave it back, asking him to read it
out to them.</p>

<p>Warner’s reason for going to Wedwell Park:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After you ascended, sir, to-day, I tried to find
Falcon and Croft at Sydenham with the aid of the
London detective, Hawksworth, but the roundabout
way he went to work in search of a clue so upset me
that I left him and proceeded in my own humble
way to act alone.</p>

<p>“Just as I was going to my lodgings, near the Lower
Sydenham Station, I met a railway clerk I know
coming that way, and I asked him if he had seen
anything of two men, one tall and dark, the other
short and sly looking, as they were wanted.</p>

<p>“‘If you step into the booking department,’ he said,
‘you will find them consulting the time tables about
a Sussex train; they are going on by the next train
to Croydon, where they will change for Lewes.
Shall I go in and get you a ticket, and arrange that
you slip into the guard’s van, Mr Warner?’</p>

<p>“‘Please do, and send on word to our inspector to
say where I am going, as it is on important business,’
I said, at the same time explaining a little to him
about the balloon ascent and the men’s recent
conduct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“‘But,’ said he, ‘do you know, Mr Warner, where the
balloon came down?’</p>

<p>“‘No I don’t,’ I replied.</p>

<p>“‘It dropped in Wedwell Park, not so very far from
Lewes, strange to say? We have had a message up
to that effect, and that is what these men are going
there about in all probability,’ said he.</p>

<p>“‘Did they reply to the telegram?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘No, but they have been away since and disguised
themselves; but I could see they were the same
parties and thought they were card-sharpers. If
you look sharp, you will have time to slip into your
lodgings and put on other clothes,’ said he.</p>

<p>“‘All right, and I’ll tread close on their heels, and
very glad I am to get a good clue without beating
about the bush,’ I said to the railway clerk.</p>

<p>“This correct information, sir, enabled me to follow
them here without their knowing it. Falcon and
Croft took a trap over, and I came in a fly—but I
warn you that they may be here bent on mischief.
I sent an earlier warning to Miss Dove not to go out
without protection.</p>

<p class="right">“S. W.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Oh, if this is from S. W., then the first was from
him too,” said the squire. “How very clever and
sharp, to be sure. I wish we had such men down
here.”</p>

<p>“Warner is a born genius in his line, squire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“I believe he is, and who was the London detective?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was the opinionated man who wanted to
arrest my friend the captain—his name is Hawksworth.”</p>

<p>“You told us about him at dinner, captain,” said
Miss Dove.</p>

<p>“Marvellous!” exclaimed the squire; “but it is
getting late, Edith. I hope the lady has recovered.”</p>

<p>“I hear Lucy just coming, papa.”</p>

<p>“The lady is fast asleep, miss, and is better,” said
Lucy in reply to her mistress’s question.</p>

<p>“Then let us all follow her example,” said the
squire, showing his guests to their rooms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>SURPRISING DISCLOSURES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> quiet and interesting conversation that Harry
Goodall had privately with Edith Dove whilst her
father and the captain had gone to see if Falcon
and Croft had been captured was neither sought nor
expected. Edith, when alone with the aeronaut, had
thought it only natural and right to offer her sympathies
to the welcome messenger from the clouds,
whose form and face seemed familiar, and whose
recent services she not only appreciated, but at the
same time felt that she was under the influence of
gratitude and fascination, which she did not attempt
to suppress, until a sudden ray of light, falling on the
aeronaut’s face, revealed to her something which she
hesitated to impart to him, in case she might be mistaken.
The idea, however, which had come into her
head, induced her to be more reserved until she had
made further inquiries of the young lady who was
with Lucy; for, if she were mistaken in her conviction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
as to where they had previously met, she might
repent of being unduly precipitate.</p>

<p>Harry Goodall, it may as well be at once confessed,
was, from the moment he met Miss Dove, the victim
of love at first sight; besides, he could not rid himself
of the notion that he had seen Edith somewhere
before, as her pretty face appeared to be slightly
familiar. This was the prevailing thought of the
aeronaut as he conversed with Miss Dove, and afterwards
he reproached himself about the utter stupidity
he had shown in not having long before sought the
acquaintanceship of the heiress of Wedwell Park, who
now seemed to him so attractive and lovely; her very
eyes beamed with a strange tenderness which was bewitching,
and when a more subdued expression crept
over her face, he thought perhaps her mind had
wandered back to Falcon, who, according to the
doctor’s insinuations, was paying his addresses to her.</p>

<p>It was whilst these similar fancies occupied their
thoughts as to their having met, that the squire and
the captain were heard to enter the hall. This ended
their chat, and led to the reading of Warner’s statement,
which tended to confirm Miss Dove’s suspicions.
We must, however, leave the unsolved difficulty for
the present, and freely admit that Doctor Peters was
right in one respect, viz., that the aerial visitors had
certainly created a great stir, and had induced the
Doves to question the pretensions of the financier,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
which were evidently bold acts of audacity, intended
for mischievous objects, for Falcon had been drawing
largely on the squire’s fortune to launch and uphold
an enterprise which had been considered most promising,
until it assumed a doubtful aspect after the
arrival of the balloonists. By this time, the doctor
also knew that the financier had been partially exposed,
and was not successful with Miss Dove, who
never had liked him.</p>

<p>After the attempt on the aeronaut’s life, Miss Dove
saw, with a woman’s instinct, that the wounded
aeronaut had a bitter enemy, and with this conviction
she went to the room occupied by Miss Chain,
on the following day, with a view of getting information.</p>

<p>Miss Dove first spoke of the pleasure she had felt
in making an ascent by moonlight, and regretted that
it had been spoiled by a mishap, though only a slight
one, as it had fortunately turned out to be, Doctor
Peters having made light of the injury.</p>

<p>“Then it is not serious?” said Miss Chain; “I am so
glad to hear that.”</p>

<p>“No, it is not serious as a personal injury, but it
casts a dark shadow somewhere, and that is why I
wanted to know how you were, and whether you felt
equal to having the chat which I proposed last evening
when I left you?”</p>

<p>“I am not quite up to it just now, I fear,” said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
lady, “but I daresay I shall be presently, Miss Dove,
when I will send and let you know.”</p>

<p>With this assurance, Miss Dove left her for a while.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Miss Chain saw Lucy, who advised
her not to mention the gentlemen’s names, even
if she was called upon to disclose her own, as it was
a fact that neither the squire nor Miss Dove had any
idea who the balloonists really were, though, said
Lucy, in her honest, blunt way,—</p>

<p>“It is sure to come out, Miss Chain, so that it
might be as well to state that you had been helping
the aeronaut in his work, and it being completed, you
were ready to take another situation.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lucy, that would be truthful, and perhaps
the right thing to do under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>Miss Chain thanked Lucy for her advice and kind
attention, and then Lucy brought out a photograph
which she thought Miss Chain had not seen, as she
was not very well on the day it was taken.</p>

<p>“Tom gave it to me,” said Lucy, “and it was given
to him by the gentleman who took it at the Crystal
Palace. Very likely it will be more useful to you
than to me.”</p>

<p>“And may I do as I like with it, Lucy?” asked
Miss Chain.</p>

<p>“Yes; show it to Miss Dove, if you like.”</p>

<p>“I recollect now, Lucy,” said Miss Chain, “that I
had been upset about the time you refer to by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
spy, whose face I am certain I saw in the photo
below on the dining-room wall last evening, and
which upset me so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard about it, but don’t you worry,
for as sure as you sit there, Miss Chain, you are on
the right path to overthrow your adversary. Take
my word for that, and I can tell you plainly that
Miss Dove never encouraged Mr Falcon; it is my
master, the squire, who has been taken in by him,
and if I had your chance, Miss Chain, I would let
my young mistress know that you believe Falcon
to be the same person who imposed on you and your
poor mother in Boulogne. However, I had better
go and tell Miss Dove that you are coming at once to
see her.”</p>

<p>When Miss Chain entered the room, Miss Dove
took a seat near her, and commenced by
saying,—</p>

<p>“I want to ask you the meaning of your remarks
about the portrait in the dining-room last evening.
You were very much excited, and you muttered to
yourself, ‘He looks as he did in Boulogne, where he
took the watch and chain.’”</p>

<p>“I do not recollect saying that, Miss Dove.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, you did, and you also said, not remembering,
perhaps, that I was there, ‘To see him parading
himself in disguise as he did at Sydenham.’ Now, I
want to know,” continued Miss Dove, “if these remarks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
had any reference to what had occurred, or were they
delusions?”</p>

<p>“No; they were true, and I was trying most likely
to relieve my feelings as to what had actually taken
place.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl! I can see that you have a grievance at
heart which may yet be redressed. I only wish that
you would stay on with me here as my friendly companion,
for I should so much like to have someone
with me who was sympathetic and straightforward.
Do you think you would like to remain with me?”</p>

<p>“I would gladly do so, but, to be candid, I should
wish first to consult that estimable gentleman, the
aeronaut, for I would not slight him on any account.”</p>

<p>“I am much interested in all of you,” said Miss
Dove, “and should like to know the history of your
troubles.”</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you frankly, Miss Dove, and will
begin by saying, no matter what your religious views
may be, that I believe we were wafted this way for
some wise and useful object.”</p>

<p>“I join cordially in that sentiment, and whatever
your history may be, I do believe that you have
been hardly dealt with.”</p>

<p>“My name is Chain, and my mother and I retired
to Boulogne after the death of my father, because our
small fortune, saved by teaching and thrift, was only
just sufficient to keep us comfortably. In an evil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
hour, a fine financier made our acquaintance under
the pretence of paying his addresses to me. He
ultimately induced us to trust him with all we
possessed for re-investment in a new enterprise, as
he said that it was one which would pay a much
higher rate of interest.”</p>

<p>“Miss Chain!” exclaimed her interrogator, with no
small agitation, “you are not only enlisting my sympathy
for yourself and your mother, but you are, without
knowing it, suggesting that my dear father may
have been similarly entrapped, and by the same man,
possibly; but pray go on, I may profit immensely
by what you are telling me.”</p>

<p>“Then, in an unfortunate hour, Miss Dove, we
handed over all that we had in the bank, when the
villain absconded with this, together with my father’s
watch and chain, which, from their peculiar construction,
I feel sure I have seen him wearing at Sydenham;
and the photo in your dining-room represents
the same man with the identical cable-laid watch
chain conspicuously portrayed.”</p>

<p>“What astonishing coincidences and villainy you
are bringing to light, Miss Chain; but I will not
stop you in case Mr Falcon should come before I
can warn my father that it is too late.”</p>

<p>“I must further tell you that, owing to our state
of poverty, we started off to London to earn our
daily bread. There we made the acquaintance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
Trigger, Lucy’s sweetheart, and he and your maid
introduced us to the aeronaut, who most kindly engaged
us to do needlework for him.”</p>

<p>“Yes? and where, please?” asked the squire’s
daughter, with an excited look in her eyes, which
quite astonished Miss Chain.</p>

<p>“It was at the Crystal Palace that he saved us
from starvation,” replied Miss Chain; but she was
sorry to see that Miss Dove was so much moved
by her story that she was crying and much upset.</p>

<p>On recovering herself, Miss Dove exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“How good and noble of him to act in that way.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear that you think so, Miss Dove,
but I can give you further proof of his having acted
the good Samaritan.”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you, Miss Chain, before you go on,
I discovered last evening that I and the aeronaut
had met before.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I will remind you very easily, Miss
Dove, when and where you did so,” went on Miss
Chain, as she drew from her pocket the photo that
Lucy had given her, representing the rescue of the
lady from the Crystal Palace lake by Harry Goodall.</p>

<p>Miss Dove, rising in great excitement, took a steadfast
gaze at the view, and exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Yes, an accurate reproduction! There is no mistaking
that figure,” she emphatically observed, with
her finger on the figure of the aeronaut, as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
dropped on to a lounge in a seemingly fainting condition.</p>

<p>Miss Chain flew to the bell rope and pulled it so
energetically that the squire, who was with Doctor
Peters, his patient and the captain, hurried up to
his daughter’s sitting-room, and on finding out the
state she was in, called in the doctor who had
followed the squire.</p>

<p>“What, dear Edith, is the matter?” asked her father.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he noticed the photograph on the
lounge, as did Doctor Peters, who was now by her
side, and exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“What, more ballooning? Oh, dear, dear! When
will this end?”</p>

<p>The squire, who was thinking of his daughter, did
not take much notice of what the doctor said, but
endeavoured to call his attention to Edith, who was
slowly recovering herself, and exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Don’t, my dear father, trouble the doctor.”</p>

<p>While the squire and he were examining the photo,
the aeronaut and the captain had begged to be
admitted, and had come over to Miss Dove and
were saying a few kind words to revive her, not
knowing the cause of her attack, though Harry
Goodall was reminded, by the appearance and size
of the photo, of that unexpected incident in his uncle’s
presence, when the ship photographer was announced,
but he little thought that it was actually one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
three photos that had been taken of the trial trip
of his air-ship on the palace lake.</p>

<p>“You can now plainly see, doctor,” said the squire,
pointing to the photo, “that my views are proving
sounder than yours hour by hour; but I thought it
was Falcon who saved my daughter’s life?”</p>

<p>“Of course you thought that the financier rescued
her, for did he not tell you so in my presence,” cried
the doctor. “You forget, however, squire, that sensational
pictures are not always to be relied upon.”</p>

<p>“That one may be,” retorted Miss Dove, in a firm
voice, “for I declare that Mr Falcon never put forth
a finger to save me. It was this brave gentleman
who did so,” cried Edith, as she grasped the aeronaut’s
hand and drew him down by her side.</p>

<p>And while a fresh interchange of tender and grateful
feeling was proceeding, the squire, Doctor Peters
and the captain were intently looking at the respective
figures in the photo.</p>

<p>Presently the squire exclaimed, with an undisguised
amount of sarcastic sharpness,—</p>

<p>“Falcon’s attitude is characteristic of the man.
Don’t you think so, captain?”</p>

<p>“I have only just seen it for the first time, Squire
Dove,” replied the captain, “and have not heard of the
occurrence previously.”</p>

<p>“Then yours will be a weighty testimony,” said
the squire. “Can you recognise the persons here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
represented? Look at them, and give us your frank
opinion.”</p>

<p>“There sits Mr Falcon!” exclaimed the captain,
“with his hand on the side of a boat and his head
bowed down—I’ll swear to him; and there is my
friend, the aeronaut, lifting a lady out of the water,
who, unmistakably bears the strongest resemblance
to your daughter, squire.”</p>

<p>“Do let us retire below stairs,” cried the host. “The
three invalids will excuse us, I know, for I am not
sure that I can summon patience much longer to
haggle with the doctor and his obstinacy.”</p>

<p>“I shall not give in by seeing a mere picture,”
cried the doctor.</p>

<p>“Then you must be totally blind to ocular demonstration,”
said the captain, moving off with the squire.</p>

<p>But when once they had reached the hall, Squire
Dove felt that he had no desire or patience to listen
to any further observations that the doctor might
wish to offer, so he was politely bowed out, when
the squire and the captain had a confidential chat
until they were joined by the aeronaut and Edith
Dove, together with Miss Chain, whose name had not
been divulged as yet, for Edith was not well enough
to enter upon the thrilling disclosures she had
listened to that morning. She remembered, however,
that a kindly-disposed policeman had told her
at the Thicket Hotel that she was saved by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
scientific gentleman, whose name was not mentioned.</p>

<p>But by way of a timely diversion, the squire proposed
a stroll in the park, to see how the balloon was
getting on, for, said he,—</p>

<p>“The more Doctor Peters raves against it, the greater
liking I seem to have for it.”</p>

<p>Here, while the inspection of the balloon was going
on, the gamekeeper drew their attention to a paragraph
in a local newspaper, which contained a reference
to the performance at Haywards Heath. It
was as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">A Flying Visit.</span>—The extraordinary experiment
lately made by a Professor Scudder and his director,
at Haywards Heath, with the object of showing a
new mode of flight, has led to inquiry respecting the
two individuals who so suddenly appeared in that
part and who disappeared so hastily. All sorts of
conjectures have been formed as to who they are and
where they came from—fortunately a snap-shot by
a local photographer was taken just before the flying
machine started, when the quasi director lost part
of his disguise and Scudder was about to start.
This photo has, we hear, been secured by someone
who is of opinion that the adventurers are not after
all Dutchmen, but two persons who have been obtaining
money under false pretences, and whose pretended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
flight through the air is thought to be a mere
ruse to draw off attention to a more extended ‘flight’
by land and sea. Further enquiries are being made,
we hear.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Quite right, too,” said the squire, “for they may
turn out to be—”</p>

<p>“Hush, papa! the doctor is coming, and may as
well be kept in ignorance of this suspicion.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>WANTED BY WARNER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Tired</span> Nature’s sweet restorer” had not been indulgent
to the visitors at Wedwell Hall, the reason perhaps
being that they were conscious of having upset
the quiet routine of the Doves by having shaken
their faith in Falcon, but they did not do so designedly
to cause mischief, but rather to expose an
outrageous impostor.</p>

<p>The aeronaut was the first to make his appearance
the next morning, before the squire or Miss Dove
were astir, and the lady’s maid, Lucy, took this
opportunity of saying a few words to Harry Goodall,
her former employer. Amongst other things, she told
him that Miss Dove and Miss Chain were fairly well,
and that they had been talking about him and saying
many sweet things about him; but the aeronaut
passed the matter by and asked if there was any
news of the runaway rascals.</p>

<p>“Lor’, sir, haven’t you heard that the men who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
attacked the cook are supposed to be burglars, and
have taken to flight?”</p>

<p>“No, I had not. Tell me about it. But I want to
hear first of all about the Crystal Palace photograph.
How came you to bring that forward, Lucy?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I gave it to Miss Chain for a good
motive. I wanted to endear my mistress to you and
to Miss Chain, if the truth must be told; but don’t
you mind what the doctor says, Mr Goodall.”</p>

<p>“I cannot be indifferent to his remarks, Lucy, for
he may be in some way mixed up with Mr Falcon.”</p>

<p>“Not he, sir. I should say that the squire had been
taken in by Mr Falcon in one way and the doctor in
another without their knowing it.”</p>

<p>“That’s not a bad idea, Lucy, and in return for it
I must tell you, as I have already hinted to Tom, that
I shall very soon make known here who we are.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear you say so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Talking about burglars, Lucy, I thought I heard
someone moving about just now.”</p>

<p>“It is your friend, sir, coming down,” said the girl,
as she looked towards the stairs.</p>

<p>“Come in, captain; I am getting the early news,”
whispered his friend Harry, whilst Lucy left the
room.</p>

<p>“And how is the wound?” asked the mariner.</p>

<p>“It is healing like a dog’s!”</p>

<p>“By Jove! You would have been done for if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
balloon had not been hauled down just at the right
moment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve no doubt my life was attempted, but the
sudden dip saved me. Had we remained stationary a
second longer, I don’t suppose I should have been
talking to you now.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here, Harry, now that we are alone, I
wish to know whether we had not better declare ourselves
before I leave, as you are clearly on the best of
terms with Miss Dove, and more so, I should say, than
if you had introduced yourself to the squire and his
daughter as a merchant’s clerk, according to your
uncle’s programme?”</p>

<p>“And my father’s, too, Link; don’t forget that.”</p>

<p>“Quite so.”</p>

<p>“The truth is, captain, we’ve no time this morning
to concoct any definite plan of campaign, as we appear
to all intents and purposes to be the agents of
destiny, and I propose that we act and speak simply
according to circumstances as they turn up. I agree,
however, that we ought to make known our names—perhaps
something may occur to enable us to do so
with good grace—so now we had better inquire what
is the latest report by Warner and the gamekeeper;
we must also see to the balloon and Trigger.”</p>

<p>“I am at your service, Harry, and by-the-bye, I
hope that you don’t disapprove of my attentions to
Miss Chain?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“That entirely depends, Link, upon four words—‘Do
you mean it?’”</p>

<p>“I do, old friend, most certainly.”</p>

<p>“Come along, then, for we’ve a lot to unearth and
unravel.”</p>

<p>It seemed that Trigger and Bennet had ascertained
that a tall and a short man had been seen to
leave the plantation and go up the lane towards the
Hall when Miss Dove was in the balloon car, soon
after the rifle was fired most likely—afterwards the
smaller man was seen to call at Doctor Peter’s house
while he was absent in the park. This information
was obtained after the local policeman and Warner
had failed to find anyone escaping in the direction of
Newhaven; but the fugitives might have gone off in
a northerly direction, although Warner thought that
they would without doubt make off in a southerly
direction, with the intention of leaving the country
by the mail steamer—that is, if they did not escape
through the air, for they both answered to the description
of two men who had been trying to fly
from Haywards Heath.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tom Trigger had not been idle in
looking to the safety of the balloon, which had
been made snug by attaching heavy weights to
the netting, which he procured from the gasworks,
and additional pipes had been placed on
the ground in case a supply of fresh gas was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
needed. The assistant had also taken other precautionary
measures, in the event of a strong wind
springing up, and he suggested the advisability
of his going up to the Crystal Palace to bring
down all the bags and other tackle for holding
down the balloon. At the same time he would
try to find out from the Sydenham police authorities
what Warner was to do, and how long he could
stay, as he was trying to be on the track of the
fugitives, though he promised to be back to confer
with the squire after he had organised a sharp
lookout down Newhaven way, where he would
not leave a stone unturned in co-operating with
the local police.</p>

<p>The squire was in the park much earlier than
was his wont, and he was accompanied by his
daughter and Miss Chain, who was better in
health, though she appeared to be very quiet and
thoughtful.</p>

<p>Doctor Peters was about this time entering the
lower gate of the park, and he went up to those
who were grouped near the balloon and congratulated
his patient on being out so early, and as
breakfast time was drawing near, and the postman
was observed on his way to the Hall, it
gave him a good excuse to accompany the party
back, and to look at the aeronaut’s head. When
the examination was over, and a favourable report<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
given, the squire, who had a local morning newspaper
in his hand, said,—</p>

<p>“You had better sit down with us, Peters, for
I have just caught sight of an article about the
balloon descent at Wedwell Park. This is what
they say:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘An ascent of an apparently scientific character
was made a few days since from Sydenham by
an amateur aeronaut, whose name has not transpired,
accompanied by an officer in the mercantile marine
and a young lady, about whom a great deal of
interest had centered, in consequence of her having
been defrauded, as it is alleged, by a swindling
financier, not unknown, too, at a certain Hall in
Sussex, and in other parts of the country. It is
also rumoured that the young lady, as well as the
amateur aeronaut, had been shadowed and annoyed
for some time by the same financier in the
neighbourhood of the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>“‘The aeronauts were at one time in Essex, but
owing to a strong upper current of a north-easterly
kind, they were driven towards the south coast,
when they dropped on the estate of a highly-respected
Sussex squire, where the balloon, to
please the latter, made some captive ascents. Then
a strange thing happened, for on the occasion of
the last ascent, when the squire’s daughter was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
in the car, a rifle was discharged at the amateur
aeronaut, the missile passing through his hat and
wounding him on the head. The squire’s medical
attendant pronounced the wound not dangerous,
but the question of motive suggested itself, and
there is reason to conclude that the attack was
made by none other than a flighty financier,
assisted probably by a confederate. Colour is
given to this supposition, as this “gentleman” did
not keep his appointment of dining with the
squire.</p>

<p>“‘The last information we had was to the effect
that the fugitive financier and his servant were
wanted.’</p>
</div>

<p>“I am truly glad that the report stops there,”
exclaimed the squire.</p>

<p>“And that no names are mentioned,” added Miss
Dove.</p>

<p>“Nor the precise locality,” said Miss Chain.</p>

<p>“Still,” cried the squire, “Falcon hasn’t a leg
to stand upon; and now, doctor, you are at liberty
to say what you like, but mind what you do say,
in case you have to eat your own words.”</p>

<p>“What I have to say is this,” replied the
doctor, still unconvinced, “You have favoured us,
squire, with a most libellous paragraph, for which
the reporter, whoever he may be, deserves to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
prosecuted, as the statements are built on hearsay,
and traduces a man whom we regarded, until the
balloonists presented themselves, as a friend; and
how do we know but what the balloonist’s financier
is as different from Falcon as chalk is to cheese?”</p>

<p>“What? After a sight of his photos and his
shadows at the Crystal Palace, besides personal
evidence of an uncontrovertible character?” asked
the squire, somewhat irritated.</p>

<p>“Doctor Peters!” exclaimed Miss Dove, “I really
haven’t patience with you! In the face of such
evidence as we have had, it is folly to persist in
bolstering up an untenable position.”</p>

<p>“And I will take leave,” said the squire, “in support
of my daughter’s spirited remarks, to put one question
to you.”</p>

<p>“Well, let me hear it, squire.”</p>

<p>“Did you send a telegram to Falcon, at Sydenham,
after the balloon came down here?”</p>

<p>“I did, Squire Dove, believing that he was
straight and true to you, to your daughter and to
me.”</p>

<p>“Then you have been the victim of an impostor,
and why not own to it?”</p>

<p>“I am not going to do that at present, squire, for
how do I know but what Falcon may walk in and
scatter like chaff before the wind all the unfair conclusions
that have been arrived at in his absence?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“Falcon will never appear here again,” said Miss
Dove. “However, there is a knock at the door.”</p>

<p>“Come in,” cried the squire. “Oh, it is the pilot.
How now, Trigger?”</p>

<p>“The policeman and Warner have returned, squire.”</p>

<p>“Tell them to come in and make their report,” said
the squire, and turning to the men as they entered,
he asked, “Have the suspected men been seen or
captured, officer?”</p>

<p>“Not at present, your worship. They have been
seen, and may have gone north, while we took the
Newhaven route.”</p>

<p>“You naturally inferred that they were leaving
the country by the Dieppe steamboat. I think that
you, Warner, have been in this neighbourhood
before?”</p>

<p>“I have, your worship, but the last time I came
down I was with Mr Falcon and Croft, in the same
train with them from Sydenham.”</p>

<p>“But where had you seen them previously?”</p>

<p>“I have seen them at the Crystal Palace more than
once, your worship. I had to lock up Croft for
trespass, and his master I found at a doctor’s house
near here in a skeleton cupboard.”</p>

<p>“What do I hear? You are surely romancing,
Warner?”</p>

<p>“No, squire, he is not,” cried Doctor Peters. “I
admit that last ludicrous allegation to be true, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
Mr Falcon, after he was shot by a poacher, as he
said, came to consult me as to the injury he received
in his back, at the same time this man, Warner, if
he really is a detective, did obtain admission to my
consulting-room, and as the cupboard was not
occupied by the skeleton, Falcon stepped in there
instead of going into the next room.”</p>

<p>This statement caused general laughter.</p>

<p>“How very odd, doctor; but you cannot gainsay
that Warner was certainly a detective on that
occasion, and a very expert one too. Ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“I think, squire,” said the doctor, “if the poacher
who shot at Mr Falcon could be produced he would
throw a different complexion on the affair.”</p>

<p>“He stands in your worship’s presence!” said
Warner.</p>

<p>“Indeed! Who is he?” said his worship.</p>

<p>“Come forward, Trigger,” cried Warner, with a
covert smile.</p>

<p>“I am no poacher, your worship,” replied Tom, as
he stood forward, “though I confess to having shot
at, and having hit, a man in the Essex marshes who
wilfully fired the gas in my employer’s balloon. And
I assert that that man was Mr Falcon, who at the
time was disguised with spectacles, false beard, sandy
wig and reversible coat.”</p>

<p>“How do you know, Trigger, that he was Mr
Falcon?” asked his worship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“He was the same person who had annoyed my
master and Miss Chain at the Crystal Palace, and the
same who did <i>not</i> attempt to rescue the lady from
the lake, but left that honour for my guv’nor to
perform.”</p>

<p>“Any further evidence?” asked the magistrate.</p>

<p>“Only as to the photo in your dining-room, your
worship, besides the one I gave to Lucy. They are
both faithful likenesses of the man I shot at and hit
in the back.”</p>

<p>At this critical moment, when the doctor seemed
somewhat confounded and rose as if he could bear
it no longer, two young women, Lucy and the doctor’s
servant, Maria, were disputing as to who ought to
catch the squire’s eye to have the first say after
Tom Trigger had done.</p>

<p>“Come forward, Lucy,” cried the squire, who had
noticed the altercation. “What is it you wish to
say?”</p>

<p>“If you please, squire, I only wish to say that my
Tom is no poacher, and as to the photo that the
doctor turned his nose up at, I can swear that it was
taken on the banks of the Crystal Palace lake, and
is a faithful portrait of Mr Falcon, who made no
attempt to rescue Miss Dove.”</p>

<p>“And please, squire,” said Maria, “may I speak?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; and what have you to say?”</p>

<p>“I ought to have said so before, your worship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
Doctor Peters is wanted immediately by a lady who
is very bad.”</p>

<p>“Hurry off, doctor,” said the squire.</p>

<p>After the doctor’s exit, Maria asked, when she saw
that her master had left, whether she could state
something that took place at their house during his
absence in the park looking at the balloon. It had
been preying on her mind, but she did not like to
make it known, because she thought the doctor would
not believe it, and would blame her.</p>

<p>“As your master has just left, Maria, I would
reserve what you have to state until he is present,
and then speak out fearlessly if it is anything that
would concern him or any of us here assembled.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether it would amount to much,
your worship, but I will follow your advice—though
people will talk about those who are
suspected.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you talk about them, Maria.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, your worship, whether they are one
and the same party.”</p>

<p>“To whom are you now alluding?”</p>

<p>“To these air-flying robbers, squire, who are said
to have come from—”</p>

<p>“Stop, my good girl, and pray confine yourself to
what can be proved. Don’t go beyond that. Certainly
I have heard with regret that two insane Dutchmen
are supposed to be at large with evil intents.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“They do seem to have method in their madness,
your worship.”</p>

<p>“You may think so, Maria, but your master and
others may hold quite different Views. Here, however,
we must stop, and not at present enlarge our
borders.”</p>

<small>ON THE TRACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> hours later, when Doctor Peters had returned
from attending his case, the squire resumed the inquiry
and at once called on Maria to make her proffered
statement.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir,” said the girl, “not long after
the balloon ascended by moonlight, and the gentleman
was shot at, a little man came to Doctor Peters’s house
to ask for the medicine that was made up for him. I
was not aware that anything had been prepared for
him, and while I was asking a question I noticed that
he held a handkerchief in his hand which smelt of
something strong. I just recollect his going upstairs,
and then I must have become insensible. When I
came to he had disappeared and the front door was
closed. I did not say anything to the doctor about
it, as I thought he might say I was hysterical and
that my head was full of fancies, but when I heard
the evidence at the last meeting, I thought it my
duty to state what had happened.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“Another far-fetched delusion, squire,” cried Doctor
Peters. “Young girls are given to go on that way.”</p>

<p>“And so are old gentlemen,” replied the magistrate.
“Anyway, I cannot blame your servant for
declaring herself as she has done; and at no distant
date, perhaps, we shall be able to judge whether
this item of evidence should be regarded as a dream
or something worth listening to.”</p>

<p>“Nothing in it, squire, take my word for that,”
replied the doctor.</p>

<p>“I hope it will turn out so,” retorted Maria,
smiling with an air of confidence, however, for she
had elicited the fixed attention and sympathy of
those who were present.</p>

<p>It was noticed that although the doctor pooh-poohed
his servant’s statement, it seemed that he
did so very half-heartedly, and several times showed
signs of being ill at ease.</p>

<p>At this juncture Warner stepped up to Mr Goodall
and gave him a letter, stating that it had been left
with him for the aeronaut just as he rose from the
Crystal Palace in his balloon, and that he had not
had an opportunity before this of delivering it.</p>

<p>Having perused the letter, the aeronaut stated that
he would read it aloud, as it had considerable bearing
on the case into which they were inquiring, although
it was from his uncle.</p>

<p>“Is your uncle an aeronaut?” asked his worship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“Oh, dear no, Squire Dove.”</p>

<p>This is how the letter ran,—</p>

<p>“My dear nephew—”</p>

<p>“Stop a minute,” interrupted the doctor. “What
is the name of the writer?”</p>

<p>“William Goodall, who is my uncle,” replied the
aeronaut, “and the letter is addressed to me, Harry
Goodall.”</p>

<p>“Then, my good sir,” observed Doctor Peters,
brusquely, as he looked at the aeronaut, “how is
it, if you are related to the brothers Goodall, of whom
I happen to know something, that you did not
make yourself known to the squire and to Miss
Dove when you dropped among us in Wedwell Park?”</p>

<p>“It was because I am a Goodall that I withheld
my own and my companions’ names, as my
uncle, like you, doctor, hates ballooning, and has
but a poor opinion of flying. He warned me never
to visit Squire Dove until I had renounced my
hobby.”</p>

<p>“Ah! it would have been well for you, young man,
if you had obeyed your uncle,” cried the doctor.</p>

<p>“I beg to differ from you there,” said Harry
Goodall; “for the concealment of my name has been
a Godsend to me.”</p>

<p>A remark which made Miss Dove lower her eyes,
while a becoming blush clearly showed that she reciprocated
the sentiment of his remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“Now proceed, Mr Goodall, if you please,” said the
magistrate.</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Nephew</span>,—Should you see Captain
Link at the Crystal Palace, will you ask him to
proceed to Gravesend with all haste, and there await
the arrival of my ship the <i>Retriever</i>, as her captain
died suddenly yesterday, and, as Link is a single man
and will not be returning just yet in the <i>Neptune</i> to
Sydney, he might be glad of a little change. Link
will find his traps on board, but he must get to
Gravesend with all speed, and proceed direct to
Cherbourg, as the <i>Retriever’s</i> cargo is due there
already.</p>

<p>“Have you seen anything of Mr Falcon, Harry?
Should he cross your path, at once apprise the police,
requesting them to keep close on his track, and let
them acquaint me of it, as I have obtained positive
evidence since Captain Link left me to visit you at
the Crystal Palace, that this precious financier is an
arrant impostor. Instruct Link to start as soon as
you can.—Your affectionate uncle,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">William Goodall</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“First of all I should like to say,” said the squire,
“how very pleased I am to make your acquaintance,
and offer my warmest welcome to Wedwell Park. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
now, Mr Goodall, will you favour us with the name
of your charming fellow-voyager?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can do that, father,” said Edith Dove, “as
Miss Chain, for that is the lady’s name, has told me
all about herself. I had better repeat part of what Miss
Chain said. ‘A portion of my history,’ she stated,
‘appears to have some bearing on the recent episodes
which have occurred. My mother and I, when residing
at Boulogne, were robbed of our little fortune by
a financier, then styling himself Filcher, and now
known as Filcher Falcon.’ This Miss Chain has
disclosed. I can quite understand his not daring
to face us all here.”</p>

<p>Miss Chain’s remarks seemed to have a disturbing
effect on Doctor Peters, for he got up and left the
room; and as no one had further remarks to make
the squire dismissed Warner and the servants, omitting
any allusion to what Maria said about air-flying
robbers.</p>

<p>No sooner were the squire’s investigations over
than the mariner, who was anxious to leave for
Cherbourg, was complimented, questioned and surrounded
by the Doves and Miss Chain, with a view
of affording him any assistance he might require,
while everyone expressed regret at his sudden departure.
The host ordered his carriage to take the
captain over to Lewes to catch the first train that
would take him to Gravesend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>Captain Link promised that he would see them
again after his trip to Cherbourg, and Miss Dove
kindly promised that they would take care of Miss
Chain; while the squire told the captain that there
would always be a knife and fork for him whenever
he could manage to return to the park.</p>

<p>Presently the carriage drove up to the door, and,
with many handshakings, the captain departed, accompanied
as far as the station by the ladies, while
Harry Goodall remained behind with the squire, at
his special request.</p>

<p>The carriage had no sooner passed out of the
lodge gates, than the squire requested Harry Goodall,
Warner and the local policeman to appear in his
private room, to hear his views as to the suspects.
One of the results of this conference was that the
squire ordered a dog-cart to convey the detective
to a brother magistrate, and to the police authorities
at Lewes, as he wished to take fresh steps to have
Warner provided with warrants for the apprehension
of Falcon and Croft, and then the detective could proceed
instanter to Newhaven, to arrest, if possible,
either or both of the fugitives. In the meantime,
the squire would not be idle in his co-operation, as
he considered that it was almost certain that the delinquents
would try to leave the country by the Newhaven
route.</p>

<p>Harry Goodall, whilst the squire was writing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
letters, proposed that they should go down the park
and ask Bennet if they had heard of anything fresh,
and decide, before Trigger left for the Crystal Palace,
to fetch the bags and traps, whether they had better
not let the gas out of the balloon? But when Squire
Dove reappeared on the scene, he emphatically said,—</p>

<p>“If I were in your place, Mr Goodall, I would do
nothing of the sort, for I cannot forget that it was
through you and your balloon that I have been rescued
from the brink of a precipice, and as long as
you like to keep it where it is, you have my sanction
to do so and to take in as much gas as you require.
Any way, don’t strike your colours to-day, or the
doctor will fancy that we are fearing an attack by
Falcon and Croft, or anyone they might appoint to do
us an injury.”</p>

<p>Complying with the squire’s wishes, Trigger was
sent off to Lewes with orders to bring down all the
aeronautic tackle from Sydenham, as it looked as if
they were about to have a change of weather, and, if
so, the balloon would not be safe with the rough
pieces of iron slung on the net-work. And Trigger
took a letter to the palace secretary, expressive of
his master’s regret for the unpleasant affair connected
with his last ascent, when Captain Link was mistaken
for Mr Falcon by the detective Hawksworth.
Harry Goodall begged also for an extension of leave
for Warner “on very important business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>Lucy went down just in time to see her sweetheart
off, but, as Bennet said, “She did look sadly!” and
no wonder, for she had a matter of considerable importance
on her mind, for Saunders, the cook, having
recovered consciousness, had just imparted to her
that she distinctly saw two men disguised making
their way out of the library not long after Miss Dove
made the balloon ascent by moonlight, when Wedwell
Hall was left with scarcely anyone to look after it.</p>

<p>Some time after hearing this startling intelligence,
Mr Goodall and the gamekeeper hurried up to the
Hall, and there met the squire’s carriage returning
with the ladies from Lewes. The aeronaut told the
coachman to delay taking the horses out, as a second
journey might be required.</p>

<p>Harry Goodall having communicated what Saunders
had stated, everyone crowded into the library, when a
rapid examination of the bureau proved that it had
been burst open and a large number of negotiable
securities had been carried off.</p>

<p>“I feel certain, sir,” said the cook, “that the thieves
were that gentleman who has been here so often lately
and his little servant!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure, cook?” asked Miss Dove.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss, I feel quite certain, though I fancied at
first that they were gas men, as their faces were black
like, but I am sure about them now by their
figures.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“I fear it is too true!” exclaimed the squire, who
dropped into a chair and seemed quite overcome.</p>

<p>“My dearest father!” cried Edith Dove, “don’t look
so broken-hearted. Have courage! We may yet recover
the property. Don’t you think so, Mr Goodall?”
as she looked over at the aeronaut with a smile which
would have nerved anyone to hope and action.</p>

<p>“Do pray cheer up, sir,” said Harry, “and let us
consult as to what is best to be done.”</p>

<p>Edith then sat down at her father’s feet, and after
some discussion, Goodall suggested that they should
wire forthwith to Lewes and Newhaven?</p>

<p>“Yes, a bright thought! Come with me, brother
Goodall, to the post-office. I feel a better man already
from what you have offered to do. Order the
carriage,” he said, turning to Bennet; “we can go on
to Lewes after telegraphing.”</p>

<p>“Your carriage is already at the door, squire,” said
the gamekeeper.</p>

<p>“Good, for there is not a moment to be lost. Be
sure, Bennet, you do not say a word about this to
Doctor Peters, or anybody else for the present.”</p>

<p>“You may rely upon me, squire, in that respect.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t we be able to detain Warner at Lewes,”
asked Harry Goodall, “if we hurried on without
stopping?”</p>

<p>“Capital thought,” said the squire. “We will do so,
and press on at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Jump up by the coachman’s side, Bennet, and urge
him on,” said the squire, as he entered, in a more
resolute spirit; “but stop at the post-office first,
Bennet.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Squire Dove,” cried Harry Goodall,
“wouldn’t it be wise to give your local telegraph
office a wide berth?”</p>

<p>“Good again, Goodall! What a far-seeing man
you are! Yes, we may save time and stop Warner
by so doing.”</p>

<p>The carriage drove off rapidly, the ladies waving,
cheering good-byes.</p>

<p>“That was a wise precaution, brother!” exclaimed
the squire, as they rolled along <i>en route</i> for the
Sussex county town, “and now that we are alone,
what about your suggestion, which no one shall
know about?”</p>

<p>“To be candid, squire, I would rather, before I unfold
it, ask Warner’s opinion as to its practicability.
If he approves of it, I might join him in
carrying it out. If he disapproves of it, we may
leave him to do his best to co-operate with other
detectives at Newhaven. But should he agree with
my proposal, I will explain the entire scheme to
you, and you shall have the casting vote as to
its adoption.”</p>

<p>“I hope you are not going to humiliate yourself
by acting personally as a detective, Goodall?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“Oh, dear, no; but don’t be too sensitive on my
account, squire; but I have just one idea that might
possibly facilitate matters—at anyrate, I will broach
it to Warner, as I have every confidence in that
man.”</p>

<p>“And so have I,” said the squire. “How opportunely
he delivered at the fittest moment your uncle’s letter,
to the discomfiture of the doctor.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! that was well put in, wasn’t it, squire?”</p>

<p>“A masterpiece indeed!”</p>

<p>The squire’s carriage had only just entered Lewes,
when Bennet was seen to be gesticulating on the box,
and was heard to cry out “Hi!” to someone in the
street. It was Warner coming from the railway
station, after having seen Trigger hurrying off to
Sydenham.</p>

<p>“Get out,” said the squire to Harry Goodall,
“and have your chat as soon as possible, while
I go to the police authorities. The carriage shall
come back and bring you up to me; perhaps, if
you agree, Warner may be in time to push on
to Newhaven by the first train, as the local police
there will not allow the fugitives to escape, and
no boat leaves for Dieppe until the tidal train
departs.”</p>

<p>Highly delighted was the squire to see the aeronaut
and the detective together when they came up in
his carriage with an air of confidence and hope, as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
they were of one mind as to Mr Goodall’s plan of
recovering the lost property.</p>

<p>It was agreed that a telegram should be sent to
Newhaven, and that Warner should proceed by the
night tidal train. As there was time to spare,
Warner proposed returning to the park to interrogate
Saunders. And although the squire gave
Warner leave to do so, he could not refrain from
a mischievous smile at the detective’s zeal in wishing
to get the cook’s version of her experiences from her
own lips.</p>

<p>“Don’t allude to our little scheme before the
ladies,” said the squire, as the carriage approached
the Hall; “and as to you, Warner, I think you
had better go round and see Saunders while you
are in the humour.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, squire, I will avail myself of this
early opportunity of picking up what I can, and
will return.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t hurry for an hour at least,” said
the squire, as he entered the Hall.</p>

<p>Harry Goodall availed himself of a word at parting
with the detective.</p>

<p>“Simon!” he said, “you are a brighter and wiser
man than ever I took you for. Keep everything
dark, except your liking for the cook. At the
same time, if you can pop in and interview Doctor
Peters, do so, as I heard privately that the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
fellow is in some trouble about what his servant
alluded to at the meeting this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, sir. I understand.”</p>

<p>“And you think our proposed plan of action will
do, Simon?”</p>

<p>“First class, sir; that is, if we keep silent, Mr
Goodall.”</p>

<p>“Everything depends on that,” were the detective’s
parting words.</p>

<p>Of course the rumours referred to by Maria and
others about the flying men and their quixotic
performances at Haywards Heath, were not overlooked
by Warner, who thought the fugitives might
have harboured the idea of escaping through the
air, or of carrying off by that route some fair
Sussex maiden. However, Warner had arrived
at the definite conclusion that Falcon and Croft
had quite abandoned any scheme of making their
exit by an aerial contrivance, and felt certain,
even if Hawksworth might have been doubtful
on the subject, that the financier and his confederate
would make for Newhaven, and rely
upon a sea passage across the Channel.</p>

<p>Warner heard that Hawksworth had been down
instituting inquiries at Haywards Heath; but the
palace policeman had no sooner endorsed Harry
Goodall’s proposed plan for Warner’s line of action,
than the latter decided upon making straightway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
for the South Coast, and of there going to work,
not only in the immediate vicinity of the railway
stations and the place of departure for the steamboats,
but his observations would extend beyond—as
far as Seaford.</p>

<small>ALARMING INCIDENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Who</span> could blame Simon Warner for being behind
his appointed time with the squire, when he had to
interview the doctor? Warner found him in a much
more amenable spirit; he seemed almost persuaded
that he had been victimised, and went so far as to
impart some special information to the detective on
the condition of silence. Doctor Peters adding that
he would himself inform the squire when and how
he thought most fitting.</p>

<p>On Warner’s return to the Hall, the squire took
him round the library, and gave him a list of what
had disappeared, with the numbers of a roll of bank
notes. This done, Warner took leave and proceeded
on his mission.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Edith and Mr Goodall were strolling
together through the park in the direction of the
balloon on the excuse of inspecting it, but more
probably to enjoy each other’s society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“Do you think the balloon in any danger should
a storm arise?” asked Edith.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I do not,” replied the aeronaut, confidently,
“for it is strong and sound.”</p>

<p>“The sky has certainly a darkened aspect,” said
Miss Dove.</p>

<p>“It has,” replied the aeronaut; “but there will be
time before nightfall to take extra precautions, and
I shall personally see to it, as Trigger is away, and
I perceive the barometer is falling.”</p>

<p>They found the balloon in such a state of repose
that the watchers strolled leisurely around it, but
Bennet and his staff of assistants were at hand and
promised that, if there was any important change
during dinner, he would advise them.</p>

<p>“Then come along,” cried the squire, “for it is for
once in a way past our regular time, and all seems
so quiet that we had better make the most of our
time.”</p>

<p>At dinner there was an artificial show of composure
about the little party of four, for their thoughts
naturally kept reverting to the robbery, while the
strange stillness had by no means a soothing effect
on the nerves. Presently there came a vivid flash
of lightning, followed by a heavy peal of thunder,
then a second larger flame of forked fluid descended
with an alarming roll of fearful reverberations among
the leaden clouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“I must go down,” said the aeronaut, pointing
through the windows to a shower of leaves, which
had been blown from the trees. “There is a strong
wind rising. It’s that I dread, not the lightning.”</p>

<p>Goodall was accompanied by his host to the
door, and as a rattling shower of rain was pouring
down, the aeronaut was provided with a mackintosh,
umbrella and wrap, and away he ran, while the
squire ordered a closed trap to be got ready, and soon
followed his young friend.</p>

<p>When Harry Goodall reached his balloon, he found
that Bennet and his helps had attached extra weights
to the net-work, but the silken globe was now greatly
agitated and swerving to and fro, presenting a remarkable
contrast to the tranquil condition in which
he found it before dinner.</p>

<p>“There’s another lively flash,” cried the gamekeeper;
“and, my word, how the thunder rolls. It is not
improving, and hark at the pattering rain on the
top of the balloon! It won’t force open the valve,
will it, Mr Goodall?”</p>

<p>“Never fear, Bennet; I always take precautions to
prevent that. The only thing I fear is that the iron
weights may dash up against the silk and make holes.”</p>

<p>“Steady the weights, my lads,” cried the aeronaut,
“as much as possible when she makes those heavy
lurches. Hold on all! There, she plunges again, and
don’t be alarmed, my men, she is in a sheltered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
haven—it is the back winds that catch her underneath
and cause those ugly flaps on her crown.”</p>

<p>“My dear Goodall!” said the squire, on his arrival,
“this frightful wind will soon put an end to your
balloon, I fear!”</p>

<p>“Not if we keep on nursing her as we have done,
squire.”</p>

<p>“Pick yourselves up, my good fellows!” said the
aeronaut to two or three men who were rolled over
among the half hundred weights as they swung
among their legs and threw them on their faces. “I
hope no one is hurt!”</p>

<p>“All right, sir, don’t mind us, we sha’n’t let go!”</p>

<p>“Stick to her, boys! Mind your legs, Bennet, and
pray, squire, mind your hands; the cords will cut
them if you hold so tight.”</p>

<p>“Never you mind me, Goodall,” cried the squire,
“it is all hands to the pumps; I can plainly see that,
and every ounce of steadying power is an object.”</p>

<p>The huge silken mass was at this time plunging
and swaying like a restive horse, and had lost much
of its symmetry; it looked as if it were impossible
that it could weather the storm. How it stood
such a buffeting amazed Harry Goodall, for the birds
at roost were being driven out of some of the trees
and sought shelter in distant shrubs, whilst, ever and
anon, the topmost branches, in shattered wisps of
leafage, came circling down among the men, and lodging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
for a few seconds on the dome of the balloon,
when they would be caught up afresh and whirl
about until a heavier gust swept them out of sight.</p>

<p>“Don’t we hear a sound of wheels in the lower
road?” asked the squire.</p>

<p>“Yes, I hear Trigger’s voice,” said Mr Goodall.
“Run, two or three of you, my lads, and help in the
bags.”</p>

<p>“There are three loads of sand in the barn,” said
the squire, “and I suppose you will substitute your
sand bags for these weights?”</p>

<p>“Yes, squire; I shall at first put the bags between
the iron weights, so as to add a couple of tons more
power—then, when we get a lull, I will take off the
metal.”</p>

<p>“The wind drops, I fancy,” said the squire.</p>

<p>“It does a little, and that will enable some of us
to fill the sacks. Bear a hand, Trigger, and go with
Bennet into the barn where the sand is, but mind
those guns, pistols and ammunition in the balloon car.
The gamekeeper thought we should be prepared for
a night attack. Show Tom where your air-gun is,
Bennet.”</p>

<p>“You don’t expect any worse attack than we’re
having, do you sir?” asked Trigger.</p>

<p>“I mean an assault by those rascals, who may be
badly disposed towards us. A lot has happened since
you have been away. I can tell you about it presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
if this lull of the wind holds; however, get
your bags filled and hooked on, in case of more fitful
gusts,” said the aeronaut, and then, turning to Bennet,
he continued,—“The squire has returned to the Hall to
order down refreshments and to soothe the anxiety
of the ladies.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon bring the bags, Mr Goodall,” shouted
the gamekeeper. “I’ll place the car and the firearms
in a snug corner, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do so, but leave the firearms inside, Bennet,
though I’ve no fear, in weather like this, that any
persons with malicious intentions will hang about
the park now after what has happened. They are
more likely to be hovering about the coast, either at
Newhaven, Folkestone or Dover, so as to clear out of
the country.”</p>

<p>“No doubt Warner has his eye on them by this
time, sir,” observed the gamekeeper. “However, we’ll
get to work, Mr Goodall, now it is a little quieter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sharp is the word in case of squalls.”</p>

<p>The squire was soon seen to be hurrying down
with some of his servants and a truck laden with
tea, coffee, cold meat and a lot of creature comforts,
with sundry bottles of more stimulating liquids and
lighter drinks for the balloonist.</p>

<p>As it was comparatively calm when they came to
hand, the squire proposed that, if half the numerous
hands could be spared, they should go into the spacious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
barn close by, and partake of something to eat and
drink, the next shift going in when they reappeared.</p>

<p>Acting on this proposal, all hands were fortified
for night work, and they were told to run over, a few
at a time, to the gasworks and dry their clothes in
the retort house.</p>

<p>Bennet asked the squire and Mr Goodall if they
would like to go over to his cottage to talk, as Trigger
had brought letters from Sydenham and Lewes, which,
in the bewilderment of the gale, he had omitted to
deliver.</p>

<p>Soon after midnight there was such an improvement
in the general outlook, coupled with a steady
rise in the barometer, that the attendants were allowed,
in divisions, to withdraw into the adjacent lane
and smoke their pipes. Shortly after, the squire had
a quiet chat with Mr Goodall, and then he proceeded
to the Hall. But Harry Goodall returned to the
balloon, where he found the gamekeeper awaiting him.</p>

<p>“Now look here, Bennet,” said Mr Goodall, in an
undertone, “we don’t want that inquisitive doctor
in the way, so I must find a means of getting rid
of him, though, to be candid, he is too outspoken
and blunt for that sort of thing, but I think it is very
likely he has been made a tool and a fool of by
that arch-demon Falcon and his crafty confederate.”</p>

<p>“I do believe you’re right, sir, and I only hope
that Warner has got them right and tight by this time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“They’re likely to double or cut some unexpected
capers, I should say, Bennet. Warner mustn’t
expect they will go direct into the Dieppe or short
sea-route steamers.”</p>

<p>“At that rate, sir, he is as likely to miss them as
not.”</p>

<p>“Quite possible, unless he is uncommonly sharp
and on the alert. Recollect that we shall have,
when daylight breaks in, to fill out with gas the
loose folds of the balloon, and get her dry. You
run over to the works,” he added, turning to Tom,
“and say I shall want as much gas as they can
spare to make up for what we’ve lost, as she will
soon throw off the wet if she is more fully distended,
and afterwards we can get her into the
sun’s rays.”</p>

<p>“Please to recollect, Mr Goodall,” said the gamekeeper,
“that most of these men, who are agricultural
labourers, will have to leave us at six o’clock.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not overlook that, Bennet, and now,” continued
the aeronaut turning to Trigger, “won’t you
get some rest?”</p>

<p>“Not I, sir; you have most need of rest.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I think, Mr Goodall,” said
the gamekeeper, “and if you go and shake down
for an hour or two in my cottage, I will call you
if it comes on to blow again, or when Trigger has
taken in gas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“Say at five o’clock, sir,” said Tom Trigger.</p>

<p>“Good, I will follow your excellent advice, but
be sure you do call me by five o’clock.”</p>

<p>“You may rely on that, sir,” said Bennet.</p>

<p>As dawn broke, the scud and the clouds were
moving swiftly under the influence of a N.N.W.
wind, though it had gone down near the ground,
so that Trigger and the workmen were enabled to
complete the inflation; but Tom did not attach the
car, nor would he move anything out of it, not
even the store of provisions nor the firearms, until
his master came out of the cottage, so that Bennet
determined to rouse him for fresh orders, for it was
a lovely morning, and, as the clouds cleared, the
power of the sun began to dry the balloon. Meanwhile,
the workpeople had some breakfast served
out to them by Bennet, who anxiously awaited
the appearance of the aeronaut.</p>

<p>When Mr Goodall arrived, he begged Trigger and
Bennet with all haste to attach the car to the
balloon, but not to remove anything in it until he
told them to do so. “And you can fix on my
water drag and the other contrivances, Tom; you
understand I daresay?” said the aeronaut, who espied
the old doctor hobbling in with two sticks and
looking like a man with a grievance that he wanted
to ventilate.</p>

<p>Tom Trigger obeyed orders, but he knew not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
what to make of his master’s movements. Something
was up, he mumbled to Bennet, which he
was not aware of himself.</p>

<p>“However, he may be going to have a flutter. I
should not be at all surprised at that,” said Trigger,
“though the wind at present does not blow in a very
fair quarter.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, no,” replied Bennet, “it is for the coast.”</p>

<p>Harry Goodall at this moment was looking bright
and full of action. He replied in a friendly way
to the doctor’s greeting, who had seen the top of
the balloon much higher than formerly above the
trees and wondered whether the aeronaut was going
to take flight; but as Mr Goodall regarded his
presence just then as an impediment to his movements,
he said,—</p>

<p>“The balloon had got so thoroughly drenched
during the storm, that she was now about to be dried,
and must be so placed, and elevated, if necessary, that
she could get the full power of the sun’s rays.”</p>

<p>This last declaration was quite enough for Tom
Trigger; it was a tip which he at once understood.</p>

<p>“But how is the head, my dear sir?” asked the
doctor.</p>

<p>“It is vastly better, thanks; but I wish I had
another box of your soft salve, doctor.”</p>

<p>“I will stump away and fetch some,” cried the
doctor. “By the way, Mr Goodall, I had no idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
that you were connected with old acquaintances
of mine. I want to talk with you—”</p>

<p>“If you are able, get the salve first, please.”</p>

<p>“My dear sir, willingly; I see you are very busy,
and will reserve my tale, which will make your hair
stand—”</p>

<p>“That will do for the present, doctor. We must
soon release these workmen. Excuse my offhandedness
just now.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly; I will fetch the salve.”</p>

<p>No sooner had the doctor moved away than he
noticed Lucy, who came from the cottage, sidling up
to Trigger, when a slight freshening of the morning
breeze caused the balloon to roll round in a graceful
sweep, which afforded the aeronaut a reason for requesting
that Lucy should keep farther away, and
allow Trigger to do his bidding.</p>

<p>Harry Goodall then joined Tom, Bennet and one
or two others, who were attaching his machinery to
the side of the car. Then he took Tom Trigger a
little aside, and said,—</p>

<p>“Slip your overcoat and things in the car; mine
are already there. You have not, I hope, disturbed
anything I placed myself therein.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Tom, “and I begin to tumble now as
to what you are after, but I wish I had known earlier.”</p>

<p>“It is quite as well as it is, perhaps,” said Mr
Goodall. “I do not want to let the gas out in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
park, and you see what a fine chance there is for
drying her aloft.”</p>

<p>“Drying her, or trying her, which am I to understand,
sir?”</p>

<p>“You know quite enough, my trusty Tom, for the
present. We must be off in ten minutes’ time. Never
mind saying ‘Good-bye.’ And here, Bennet, request
these men not to shout or make the slightest noise,
as I am off for a short trip; and you won’t mind
trusting your firearms in our care, as the taking
them out might create some astonishment. You
understand, Bennet?”</p>

<p>“I begin to, sir. But what am I to say to the
squire and the ladies?”</p>

<p>“Tell the squire all that took place truthfully.
He knows what my intentions are.” Then, turning
to Tom, the aeronaut said,—“Is the ballast
ample, Tom? Just give me a lift into the car,
Bennet.”</p>

<p>“And ease up this rope,” cried Trigger, “when Mr
Goodall gives the word.”</p>

<p>“Now, then,” said Mr Goodall, “ease away the
rope, Bennet.”</p>

<p>“Throw one bag of sand out, Tom. She will do
now. We’re off, Bennet.”</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” cried Lucy, “may I speak to Trigger?”</p>

<p>“The moment he returns, you can, Lucy,” said
Mr Goodall, as they rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“She mounts beautifully over the trees, Trigger.”</p>

<p>“She does indeed, sir,” said Tom, who, although
Lucy was crying, kept his eye in advance of them.</p>

<p>Every workman raised his hat or cap as the balloon
ascended, with the most obedient and respectful
silence. Looking towards the hall, Mr Goodall saw
Squire Dove at his open bedroom window waving
both hands, while a voice in the lane was heard to
cry out,—</p>

<p>“Stop, my good sir, where the dickens are you
going to? I’ve brought the salve.”</p>

<p>“Thanks! Good morning, doctor; I’m due near
Newhaven in less than twenty minutes, and could
not possibly wait longer.”</p>

<p>“Depend upon it,” cried Lucy, “they’re gone to do
something more than dry the balloon. I’ll give it to
Tom for not letting me know what they are up to.”</p>

<p>“Tom knows no more than you or I do,” said
Bennet. “I can vouch for that.”</p>

<p>Next came the doctor, struggling and limping along
on his two sticks, while he flourished one of them in
the air at Bennet, in denunciation of Mr Goodall’s
sudden flight.</p>

<p>“This must have been a pre-arranged insult,” he
said to the gamekeeper. “I had something important
to tell him, and my opinions have changed entirely
with respect to his affairs. He doesn’t know, perhaps,
that I have been robbed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“He knows that the squire has, and Mr Goodall
may be after the thieves, for all we know,” said the
gamekeeper.</p>

<p>“That is just what I am doing, Bennet. Don’t
you see my trap in the road? I’m going now to
telegraph to Scotland Yard.”</p>

<p>“But for what we know, doctor, the aerial voyagers
may be in pursuit of the fugitives?”</p>

<p>“Believe me, Bennet,” cried the converted doctor,
“if I thought young Goodall would come across and
capture those villains in whom I, too, have been
grossly deceived, I would leave him all I have.”</p>

<p>“What a change has come over you, doctor!” exclaimed
Mrs Bennet.</p>

<p>“I own to that,” said the doctor, “and I will tell
you why and all about it soon, but I must go now
and wire, for there is no believing anybody in these
days. But see, Bennet, the balloon is fast driving
towards Newhaven.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she certainly is,” said the gamekeeper, “and
I trust that none of us will tell the young ladies or
the squire, for to-day at anyrate, what we have been
talking about, as it would be cruel to increase their
troubles at a moment like the present.”</p>

<p>After the doctor had bowed assent to this suggestion,
he hurried away. The balloon was then
travelling coastwards.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>WAITING FOR NEWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Edith Dove and Miss Chain met on the morning
after the storm, the weather had much improved,
and they eagerly awaited Goodall’s joining them at
the breakfast table, to hear how the balloon had fared
during the night. Their surprise was, therefore, very
great when the squire came in and announced that
they might look for Goodall in vain, at anyrate for
the present, as he had ascended soon after sunrise,
the atmosphere being so inviting that he preferred
to dry his balloon in the sun’s rays instead of retaining
it in the wet park.</p>

<p>“And do you think, my dear father, that Mr
Goodall would act in that way without any intimation
of leaving us so suddenly?” said Edith, with
some degree of feeling.</p>

<p>“He left us most affectionate remembrances,”
replied the squire, “so Bennet tells me, for I have
been down the park and have only this minute
returned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“Did Mr Goodall go alone, papa?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear no, Trigger was with him, but he made
no mention, that I heard, as to how far he was going,
and it was amusing to hear how he gave the doctor
the slip. Peters, it appears, came in very early and
was prying about, wanting in a more friendly spirit
to know this, that and the other, when our friend
Harry, in a humorous way, sent him off on a fool’s
errand. After breakfast, we may get some news as
to where they descended.”</p>

<p>“They will have to make,” said Miss Chain, with
evident anxiety, “an exceedingly short trip.”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” said Edith, “considering that
the wind blows towards the sea. Surely they would
not drop near the Channel.”</p>

<p>The squire, who wanted his breakfast, replied
curtly,—</p>

<p>“I daresay they will; but pray, Edith, do not let
us enter upon fruitless speculations, as we may hear
at any moment that they are perfectly safe.”</p>

<p>“I’m not at all sure that this ascent of Mr Goodall’s
was not premeditated,” said Miss Dove, seriously,
“for I noticed when Mr Goodall and you, father, left
us in the carriage for Lewes, that you both were
evidently hatching some mysterious plan, and I
passed a most restless night in consequence, but I
hope that no wild adventure has taken place.”</p>

<p>“My dear, Edith, if we fail to receive good news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
before dinner, I will readily grant that I was wrong
for not advising Harry Goodall to let out the gas
before the storm came on,” replied her father,
evasively.</p>

<p>“How I wish it had been,” said Edith, who looked
at Miss Chain, with anxiety depicted on her face.</p>

<p>“I knew,” added the squire, “that our brave
young friend would sooner—well, I won’t say what.
Be patient. It will all be right in the end, depend
on it.”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t take a gloomy view of things, dear
Edith,” said Miss Chain, “for, even if he were to
attempt to cross the Channel, I have heard Mr Goodall
say that if ever a balloon was fitted for service of
that kind, his new silk balloon was the one. But
you are eating nothing, dear.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I don’t seem to have any appetite.”</p>

<p>The squire did not choose to explain himself
further, although he inferred from Miss Chain’s
demeanour that she, to some extent, shared Edith’s
fears.</p>

<p>Soon after Doctor Peters arrived, and before he
could be stopped, he blurted out that he “had news in
more ways than one, and had just had a message
from a friend who lived near Newhaven to say that
a balloon, reported to have ascended from Wedwell
Park, failed to effect a landing near the South Coast,
and had been driven out to sea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“I, for one,” cried the squire, with great vehemence,
“am not in the least alarmed by what you state,
Peters, though I do not thank you for offering this
intelligence to my daughter instead of to me, as it
savours of the pessimism which is your ruling complaint,
and I don’t believe a word of it, and can assure
you that I have thorough confidence in the aeronaut’s
skill and feel assured of his safety.”</p>

<p>“That is all very well, squire, if the balloon has
sustained no injury.”</p>

<p>“I insist upon it, Peters, that just now, in my
daughter’s presence you keep your croaking tongue
within your teeth, and if you in any way further
espouse Falcon’s cause, or anyone belonging to him,
I shall hold you guilty of being connected with him
in some way or other.”</p>

<p>“Hold me guilty, squire! why, I am now quite on
another tack, being in possession of fresh information.”</p>

<p>“You may or may not be, but if I thought you had
in any way communicated with him since he has
proved himself a villain, I would, notwithstanding my
position, turn you out of the house!”</p>

<p>“Stop, stop, squire. A threat to commit a breach
of the peace from a magistrate—that is too dreadful
to think about.”</p>

<p>“Is it? Well, you had better take yourself off with
your forebodings of evil. You would raise the blood
of a saint.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“Indeed, squire, I was just going to tell you how I
have been myself treated by Falcon.”</p>

<p>But Squire Dove, whose back was up, ignored the
remark, regretting, however, when he was cooler, that
he had not heard the doctor out. For, as Edith Dove
said, “Falcon might have done the doctor some
harm; he had certainly something on his mind.”</p>

<p>“If so, Edith, we shall soon hear about it; and one
can always feel and express regret for hasty behaviour.
If I have done Peters the least injustice,
I shall be the first to apologize.”</p>

<p>At length the post arrived, bringing an important
letter from Mr William Goodall, Harry’s uncle. It
was addressed to the squire, who read it out to the
ladies with a view of diverting their minds from
the disagreeable impressions which had been produced
by the doctor’s ill-timed visit. The letter was as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Dove</span>,—I was much pleased with your
account of the sensational version of my nephew’s
unpremeditated visit to you, which appeared in a
Sussex newspaper.</p>

<p>“I was truly glad to hear that Harry Goodall
made a favourable impression on you and your
daughter, and that he and his companions had been
invited to remain for a time at Wedwell Hall.</p>

<p>“The fact of Harry having made your acquaintance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
through the medium of his balloon, was indeed a
great surprise to me, especially as I had told him
that you and Miss Dove would never receive him as
a visitor whilst he was addicted to ballooning; and
when I heard that it was in that character he won
your good opinion, I was delighted though astounded
at the news, as it convinced me that ‘Nothing is
so certain as the unexpected.’</p>

<p>“And it seems that it was through Harry that you
were led to finding out what a designing rascal that
man Falcon is, so that I cannot reasonably take my
nephew to task for pursuing his favourite pastime,
after all is said and done. As I shall be down your
way shortly, I will do myself the pleasure of calling
at Wedwell Park when we can talk over Falcon’s
misdeeds.</p>

<p>“I myself happen to possess a photograph of the
lake incident at the Crystal Palace to which you
allude. It was through my advice that my nephew
suppressed the circulation of it, but I detected the
likeness of Falcon in the boat, though I was not sure
as to the identity of your daughter being the lady
who was rescued by Harry Goodall. I now congratulate
Miss Edith and yourself on the event, and I thank
you for your polite attention to Captain Link and to
his lady friend, whom Miss Dove is so much charmed
with. I am expecting to hear of Link’s arrival in Cherbourg,
and am glad to say that he stands very high in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
my estimation, and is the most trustworthy captain in
my employ.</p>

<p>“I will not dilate on the good opinions formed of
him in Sydney, as the revelations I shall have to
make in reference to Falcon, will be connected with
the ship <i>Neptune</i> which Link commanded.</p>

<p>“At this moment, I cannot fix the day on which I
hope to see you, as it will depend upon the arrival of
a steamer with two passengers on board from the
Cape. With kind regards to yourself and Miss
Dove,—I remain, faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">William Goodall</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“I think after that letter,” said the squire, “we
shall have to await philosophically the full tide of
events. In the meantime, I shall be glad to know,
Edith, if you have heard anything from Lucy that
will throw any more light on the situation.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear father, Lucy did not think that
Trigger knew what was his master’s real aim in ascending.
He must have been hurrying on the preparations
for what appeared to be a complete voyage
of discovery. But she had no hint from Trigger, and
the gamekeeper could not fathom what their objects
were or their destination.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose they had,” said the
squire.</p>

<p>“But it must have been something, papa, beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
the mere drying process, as they were equipped as
if for an aggressive expedition.”</p>

<p>“I do hope, dear,” said Miss Chain, “that you were
wrongly informed there. They might have had instruments
for observations and meteorological research.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they had very different implements from what
you mention, my dear,” said Miss Dove. “There
were strange-looking appliances outside the car, and
within there were guns, pistols, an air-gun and I
don’t know what besides.”</p>

<p>“Let me,” said the squire, “say a word about that
part of the story. Bennet explained that he had
provided firearms in case any attack was made on
the balloon by night, and these weapons were for
safety placed in the car; but when Mr Goodall resolved
upon baulking the doctor’s curiosity, he would
not wait to have the balloon pulled down for that
purpose, and I think, under the circumstances, Harry
was right to slip cable, for the doctor might have
terrified you more by any reference to the firearms
than he did by his message that a balloon had been
seen going out to sea.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Miss Chain, were there firearms in the
car when you ascended from Sydenham?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear no, I am quite sure there were not.”</p>

<p>“How now, Lucy?” asked the squire, as the maid
entered with a letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“It is from the harbour-master at Newhaven, sir.
Shall the man wait for an answer?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by all means. This is what he writes,” said
the squire:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘I am glad to say that the detective from Sydenham
and Wedwell Hall has been on the lookout for
the two men wanted. One was seen to go on board
a foreign vessel which was lying off the port. He
was a little man, but had a bag with him. Have you
dispatched a balloon from the park? If so, it is going
across the Channel splendidly; it made a temporary
halt at Bishopstone. Please reply.’</p>
</div>

<p>“Yes, certainly I will, and thank our friend at
Newhaven for such very welcome news.”</p>

<p>“Welcome news, papa?”</p>

<p>“Why not, Edith, it is far more reassuring than
the doctor’s version. What say you, Miss Chain?”</p>

<p>“It accords with Mr Goodall’s views as to the
competency of his balloon.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” cried the squire. “I regard it as a promising
instalment of good news, and shall look for
better in the morning.” Then turning to Lucy, the
squire said,—“Tell the bearer that if he will sit down
I’ll speak with him.”</p>

<p>After the squire had gone below, Miss Chain said,—</p>

<p>“I really do sympathise with you, Miss Dove, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
cannot understand what Mr Goodall is bent on accomplishing.”</p>

<p>“He is perhaps attempting to cross the Channel
with the idea of pursuing the fugitives in France, but
to me,” said Miss Dove, hysterically, “it seems fearfully
venturesome.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope it will all end well,” said Miss
Chain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>UP ALOFT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Harry Goodall and Tom Trigger had left the
park and Doctor Peters in the lurch, a grand view
burst upon them as the balloon mounted to an elevation
of over two thousand feet, when the rays of the
bright sun enlivened the Sussex scenery and began
to dry the saturated silk.</p>

<p>Magnificent, however, as the change proved, the
voyagers had no time to dwell upon such matters,
for the open sea lay before them, and they were
drifting towards it rapidly and in the direction of
Newhaven. Up to this time, Goodall had kept his
real project from Trigger, but now that the aeronaut
and his assistant were alone in the empyrean, there
was no longer any reason for concealing from Tom
that they were not aloft solely for the object of
drying the balloon, but principally to carry out the
daring and novel idea of pursuing the fugitives,
Falcon and Croft, should they have crossed over to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
Dieppe by the steamer from Newhaven. And certainty
as to this Goodall expected to get from Warner,
whom he had arranged to pick up and take in his
balloon somewhere near the coast by preconcerted
signal. This was the scheme concocted by Harry
Goodall, and listened to with approval by the squire
when they journeyed to Lewes, though, of course,
it was not finally settled until Warner had agreed to it.</p>

<p>Harry Goodall, soon after passing the Sussex
Downs, in pursuance of this piece of aeronautic
strategy, lowered a long trail rope to check the
speed of his balloon over the marshes, so that he
could pull up with less difficulty as they drew near
to the coast. And on his side, Simon Warner was
fortunately enabled to expedite the aeronaut’s efforts
on noticing the balloon by picking up a fly returning
from the station. This was a special bit of good luck,
as the fly man, Richard Trimmons, knew the country
intimately and had done a little ballooning himself.
Directly they caught sight of the balloon, they commenced
signalling to Mr Goodall to anchor near
Bishopstone Church where there was a sheltered
spot. Here, two other Seafordites, viz., Blucher Gray
of Pelham Place, and Mr Charles Strive, a retired
chief officer of the Blatchington coastguard, presented
themselves, and they very obligingly, together
with others, rendered valuable assistance in securing
the balloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>On this being effected, the detective rushed up to
Harry Goodall with great glee and shook hands.</p>

<p>“Well, Warner, what is the news?”</p>

<p>“F. has baffled us, sir, up to the present time, but
he is believed to be not far off. C. has escaped in
a fishing-lugger. I saw him put off in a boat,
but the French craft weighed anchor immediately
and set sail, so that I could not overtake him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know of whom you are speaking,” said Mr
Strive, “but I saw a man put off to the lugger, and I
noticed him particularly, as I saw at a glance that he
was not a pilot from his gait, let alone what he
carried. The little fellow had a black leather bag,
not at all what a seaman would have owned. I was
on the old battery fore-shore; he seemed to be afraid
lest the sea should get into his bag.”</p>

<p>“I was too far off to notice that,” said Warner, “but
I am sure he was Eben, Mr Goodall.”</p>

<p>“We have picked up important news, Tom,” said
the aeronaut to Trigger.</p>

<p>“You’re just about right, sir,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“And you are ready to go along with us, Warner,
just as you are?”</p>

<p>“I am fully prepared, sir, and have my warrants,
handcuffs and dusting-irons in this bag, and am
ready for one or both of them if we can see them
on the other side, or overhaul them on the high
seas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“Jump in, then, while Trigger puts out ballast equal
to your weight. What do you scale, Warner?” asked
Mr Goodall.</p>

<p>“About eleven stone, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then chuck out six sand bags, Tom, when I tell
you, but, first, I should like to thank our friends here
for their kind assistance.” Turning to them, he remarked
“that they could do him one or two little
favours if they would be so obliging.”</p>

<p>“Name them,” said Mr Strive.</p>

<p>“In the first place, please to bring in that grapnel,
Mr Gray, and if you are going to Newhaven, I will
thank you to call on the harbour-master and just tell
him what you have seen; and if you can pick up and
tell him anything more about the Wedwell Park
fugitives, do so.”</p>

<p>“I read something about <i>them</i> in a Sussex paper,”
said Blucher Gray.</p>

<p>“What sort of man was the other one who is missing?”
asked the fly man, Trimmons.</p>

<p>“A fine, tall-looking man,” said Harry Goodall,
“the very reverse of the fellow we are now in pursuit
of.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me very forcibly,” said Blucher Gray,
scratching his head in a reflective way, “that the
captain of the French lugger is a person I know.”</p>

<p>“Then just dot his name down on paper,” cried
Warner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>“Now, can you tell us, Mr Strive,” asked the
aeronaut, “if that lugger had anything peculiar in
her rig and cut by which we may be better able to
make her out from aloft?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Here I will sketch you an outline of
her general appearance, and the number on her sails,
sir, and I don’t fancy that you will see many fishing
luggers crossing the Channel so soon after last night’s
gale. You will make her out, therefore, the more
easily; but with the fresh northerly breeze she will
be a long way ahead of you.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. I am allowing for that, Mr Strive, but
a balloon will travel very fast in this fresh upper
current into which we shall soon mount. Perhaps
one or other of you may hear of the other party who
is wanted. And do, please, accept my best thanks
for your valuable hints, gentlemen,” said Harry
Goodall.</p>

<p>“Come here, fly man,” said Warner to Dick Trimmons.
“I haven’t paid you for the lift you gave me.
Take the coin now, and please tell me who the gent
was you took over, as you told me, so early to Newhaven?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know his name; he is a stranger in Seaford,
but now I come to think of it, he is uncommonly
like the tall gentleman you’re after.”</p>

<p>“How was he dressed?”</p>

<p>“He looked like a yachtsman, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“There is a yacht lying in the harbour,” said Mr
Strive, “but I don’t think Trimmons’s fare was anyone
you’re looking for.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know so much about that,” said Warner.</p>

<p>“I’m not myself sure,” said Harry Goodall, “but you
can mention the fact to the harbour-master, Gray.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p>“I would recommend you now, gentlemen,” said
Mr Strive, “to make the most of your time, and if
we can hear anything that will assist you, either of
us can give information where it will be thankfully
received, without mentioning localities or names.”</p>

<p>“A good idea,” cried Mr Goodall. “And now, do
you happen to have a road-side inn near here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, there is the ‘Buckle’ close at hand, a
nice, snug, road-side house of call.”</p>

<p>“Well, please to refresh these helps with this
sovereign’s worth of whatever they like best to ask
for. I suppose they have teetotal drinks at the
‘Buckle?’”</p>

<p>“Yes, all sorts there, sir.”</p>

<p>The ex-chief officer then cried out,—</p>

<p>“Three cheers, you men!”</p>

<p>And away went the aeronaut in excellent spirits.
Warner, when asked how he liked the outlook and
the pace at which they bowled along, replied,—</p>

<p>“Not so fast, is it, Mr Goodall?”</p>

<p>“It may not seem so to a novice,” said the aeronaut,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
“but if you keep your eye on those two full-rigged
ships in the distance, and then look back at the
‘Buckle’ Inn, Warner, you will soon see the rate at
which we are moving.”</p>

<p>Warner had his own binocular, and used it as if he
were accustomed to aerial reconnoitring but the increasing
extent of the sea-scape, together with the
rapid movement of the balloon from the shore, and
the nearer approach of the shipping in their eight
miles distance from the coast, soon convinced the
anxious detective that they were going much faster
than he supposed.</p>

<p>Tom Trigger kept his eye on Warner, while Harry
Goodall studied his map and instruments, not that
Tom thought their bold passenger would fall overboard
or funk, but he feared that the aerial detective
might tread upon the armoury which had been stowed
away so carefully beneath a canvas covering before
they left Wedwell Park.</p>

<p>Presently Warner’s attention was called to the
firearms by a timely caution, for Simon kept turning
himself round with a jerk, first on one tack and
then on another, as if he could scarcely make out
whether they were going back to the Sussex coast or
making straightway for mid-Channel.</p>

<p>It was owing to the occasional rotation of the
balloon on her own axis that he became so bewildered,
and he acknowledged, when the cause was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
explained to him, that one required a knowledge
of practical ballooning to decide the line of advance
in the air. It was the rotary motion which made
him lose sight of the two ships which he was
searching for.</p>

<p>“They have disappeared,” said the aeronaut, in a
joke.</p>

<p>“Foundered do you mean, sir?” asked Simon.</p>

<p>“No, but they have turned up behind us.”</p>

<p>On looking back towards the coast, Warner found
that they had passed over them in about twenty
minutes from the time they left. He then knew
that they were going ahead without giving much sign
as to their progress, so far as motion or unpleasant
sensation were concerned.</p>

<p>“If that is the way big ships are dodging about,”
cried Warner, “I must keep a sharp lookout for the
lugger.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the aeronaut, “and I am instructing
you how to do so, though I have no expectations of
seeing her yet.”</p>

<p>“If they show fight, sir, we shall present a fine
target.”</p>

<p>“Decidedly, Simon, but we shall be able to defend
ourselves, and then, you know, we have the advantage
of a more elevated position, even if we close with
them. Besides, you see those outside contrivances?”</p>

<p>“What about them, Mr Goodall?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“Oh, a great deal. That canvas bag, or cone, can
be lowered so as to check our speed, or bring us to
on the water, and the other device is to deflect our
course, either one way or the other, if we have to
drop upon them when the wind is not altogether
fair; and then the two combined will furnish us
with a fair amount of steering power, if once we
lower near the sea, but without dipping into it,
Simon.”</p>

<p>“That may be another vital point, sir,” said the
detective.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I will tell you of a third. In the event
of a scrimmage, we can hoist that lee-board to afford
us protection.”</p>

<p>“That may be one more vital consideration, sir.
But dare we use firearms under a balloon? Would not
the gas become ignited?”</p>

<p>“If we were to blaze away up here it might, but
not if we board the lugger under fire, Simon. Do
you follow me?”</p>

<p>“I do, sir, without turning a hair, and only wish
we had the chance of doing so.”</p>

<p>“You will clearly understand, my plucky friend,
that should we swoop down a few thousand feet and
come to close quarters, the gas in the lower part of
the balloon would shrink, because the atmosphere
is heavier on the surface of our planet, and there,
if no gas was in the lower portion of our balloon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
none could pass out to risk an explosion, so that
down below arms of precision could be discharged
in safety.”</p>

<p>“There’s more to learn in ballooning, Mr Goodall,
than a lot of people think of, and I can see now
that your plans for guiding might prove, in actual
conflict, more reliable than one-half of these pretended
inventions for flying and dodging about an
enemy and destroying London by dynamite.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it won’t do in aeronautics, Warner, to
have much to do with <i>flight</i>, unless you can do it
quickly and safely, if I may pun a bit among ourselves
up here, for unless you can make a masterly
retreat, or an unseen approach in a balloon, it becomes,
as you said just now, a sightly target, and is more
likely to be brought down by marksmen from below,
than for roving riflemen to hit while aloft, or to
do harm when they are flicking about hither and
thither, and having it sharp themselves, perhaps,
between wind and gas.”</p>

<p>“Ay, under the flank, sir, you mean, in a tender
and vital part; but how, then, shall <i>we</i> fare, sir, if
we have to chastise the crew of the lugger if they
don’t surrender Croft?”</p>

<p>“If we attempt that we shall be at a low elevation
and almost stationary. Even then I should not think
of wasting an ounce of powder or shot, unless we were
first attacked and driven to act on the defensive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“You haven’t told Warner, Mr Goodall,” said Tom
Trigger, who had been thoroughly enjoying the rehearsal,
“that besides all sorts of firearms, we are
provided with an air-gun.”</p>

<p>“A most suitable weapon, I should say,” replied
the detective, “for with that you might wing or
disable them without making a noise, which might
be a further vital point, sir; but as to myself, Mr
Goodall, I beg to say that I am provided with my
own bull-dog.”</p>

<p>“Revolver, you mean, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“I sit corrected, sir, and need not produce my pistol
in evidence.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t do that if it is charged, Simon.”</p>

<p>“It is as empty, sir, as my poor stomach, which,
to tell you the truth, Mr Goodall, has had nothing
solid in it for fifteen hours at least, and what with
looking for Croft last evening and for the balloon
this morning, I have entirely neglected myself.”</p>

<p>“No doubt Warner is as hungry as a hunter, sir,”
said Trigger, as if he were saying one word for the
detective and two for himself.</p>

<p>“Warner <i>is</i> a hunter, Tom, and will do honour to
the chase; but pipe to breakfast—I had forgotten
what we had in store—and give Warner a dash of
cognac with a bottle of aerated water to begin
with.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the water, Mr Goodall, I am pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
well aerated already; but what with the sea air
and the bright prospects before us, I can do some
of that tempting-looking tongue and the corned beef
that Trigger has produced.”</p>

<p>“They were thoughtfully provided by Squire Dove,”
said the aeronaut.</p>

<p>“Then here’s good luck to him and to us all, and
may we collar Croft and recover the squire’s stolen
property.”</p>

<p>“We will gladly join in that sentiment,” said Mr
Goodall, “and I will either keep Warner company by
feeding, or abstain like Tom Trigger.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about my abstaining, sir, for it is as
much as ever I can do to keep my hands off these
good things, that is, until I’m told to start.”</p>

<p>“Let us all hands go ahead then, steward, for I
have often read that Englishmen can fight and work
quite as well on a full as an empty stomach, and
I hope that the raised pie and the tongue will not
dim our sight, even if they diminish our hunger.”</p>

<p>“I can see further now, sir, than I could half an
hour back,” cried Warner, as he looked towards Tom
to have his glass replenished.</p>

<p>“I know you can see into your tumbler,” said
Trigger, “and that it is empty.”</p>

<p>“Cease firing your jokes, you two, and lend me
your glass, Warner,” cried Harry Goodall, as he
shaded his eyes with one hand. “Be serious now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
my lads, for I can see the French coast, and a mist
is rising behind it.”</p>

<p>“The wind over the land seems very variable,” said
Trigger. “Look at the smoke from those steamers,
Mr Goodall.”</p>

<p>“Any doubt about our popping across, sir?” asked
the detective.</p>

<p>“Not unless the upper current in which we are
bowling along changes,” said Harry Goodall. “In
that case we may not fetch the land where we expected
to do.”</p>

<p>“If I can only cast my eyes on Croft, and place the
handcuffs round his wrists, I don’t mind a ducking,
sir,” said Warner.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget that he is as slippery as an eel,
Warner,” cried the aeronaut, whose telescope was
directed on some small vessel in the distance.</p>

<p>“It grows darker over the land, sir!” said Trigger.</p>

<p>“It does, Tom, and that is why we shall have all
our work to do in sighting the lugger before the sea
fog envelopes her, that is, if she is, as we suppose,
between us and the French coast.”</p>

<small>THE FIGHT IN THE FOG</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> be exposed to the risk of disappointment when
the intrepid voyagers were two-thirds of their
way across the Channel was terribly annoying.
Their failure or success, seemed to depend on the
fickle wind, but Harry Goodall did not lose heart,
being confident in his own prowess and resources,
and being buoyed up with reminiscences of his own
good luck on previous occasions, especially under
the circumstances attending his arrival in Wedwell
Park.</p>

<p>Harry Goodall assured his companions, therefore,
that all the time the wind was blowing from a
northerly direction, they could pass on into France,
even if they had to allow the fishing-lugger to slip
out of their grasp, as she might do, if Croft saw the
balloon advancing in pursuit of him. The great
point they had to study was this, could they get
sight of the French craft before the thick mist that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
was gathering over the coast, covered the interval
of sea that was before them?</p>

<p>“We are now, I should guess,” said Harry Goodall,
“about twelve miles from Dieppe, and we are inclining
to the southward of that port. We must therefore
strain every nerve to ‘spot’ the lugger.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, sir!” cried Trigger. “What do you make
of that vessel further down to our right?”</p>

<p>“By Jove, Tom! Here hand me over Mr Strive’s
sketch while Warner looks at her with his glass. He
knows more about her than we do.”</p>

<p>“That’s she right enough,” exclaimed the detective,
“and I can actually make out her number—365.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, that’s the vessel to a certainty, Warner.
And, I say, just look at that steamer, miles away, coming
from the north; you see that her smoke is drifting
towards us, which clearly shows that the wind has
changed below. Still, we are holding our own up
here, and we are moving towards France.”</p>

<p>“Do you notice, sir,” said Trigger, “how fast the
fog is bearing down on the lugger?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right; I have been observing that,
Tom, for some minutes past, and I noticed, too, that
they have somewhat altered their course. Depend
upon it, Croft has seen the balloon, and is trying to
make for Havre, but we are moving that way too,
which will favour the scheme I now intend to
adopt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“The lugger,” said Warner, “Will be hidden by the
fog in a few minutes, Mr Goodall.”</p>

<p>“So much the better,” replied the aeronaut, “and
my mind is now fully made up what to do before
the fog lifts, and if we drop quickly, but fail to
grapple with her, we can re-ascend into the higher
current and pass into France. I have well calculated
our distance, and intend to descend on the other side
of her, in fact, between her and the coast, because
then the easterly breeze below will carry us towards
her, exactly on the side they won’t expect to see us,
and should we not be running absolutely straight on
to her, we can make the necessary divergence by
means of the drag and deflector. Do you follow me,
Warner?”</p>

<p>“I think so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Right. Well, now, I will let out gas and make a
swoop through the fog, so be ready, Tom, with the
drag, and you, Warner, must stand by and be prepared
to unship sand at a moment’s notice.”</p>

<p>A rather rapid drop was then made, Harry Goodall
having calculated that he would break through the
mist at about a mile, more or less, to the east of the
lugger, when the breeze off the French coast would
facilitate his project.</p>

<p>“Smothereens!” cried Warner, “but we’re in the
fog now, and no mistake.”</p>

<p>“Silence, there,” enjoined Harry Goodall, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
hushed but decisive tones. “Be ready with the
sand.”</p>

<p>A few moments of perfect quiet ensued, then came
the word of command.</p>

<p>“Let go your drag, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Out it is, sir, and has struck the water. Ah!
she’s checked now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all right,” whispered the aeronaut,
“but we want just a little more ballast overboard,
or we may touch the waves. You see we have to get
a proper equilibrium, Warner, between our ascensional
power and the drag of our water anchor. And
now,” said Harry Goodall, with bated breath, “it is a
case of hit or miss. Keep perfectly still, for we must
listen for their voices.”</p>

<p>For some time the party careered along at about a
hundred feet above the waves, which had become less
rough, so that the balloon was comparatively steady,
though their motion could be felt as the drag rose
and dipped in the water.</p>

<p>“We can’t see far ahead,” said Warner, in an undertone.</p>

<p>“No, we shall have to be guided by sound, and the
less we say, Simon, the more we may hear,” replied
Goodall to the detective, whose conversational powers
were difficult to restrain.</p>

<p>For the next half hour they were in a state of suspense
and uncertainty, not knowing whether they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
had overshot their mark, or were going too far
north or south to be within measurable distance of
the lugger.</p>

<p>Trigger busied himself with a coil of rope, which
he first fastened to the hoop, and, after doing so, he
divested himself of his coat and boots; he then attached
the other end of the rope round his waist,
which amused Mr Goodall and Warner, especially the
latter, who wanted to know what he was preparing for.</p>

<p>“A miss would be as bad as a mile,” whispered
Tom. “We might give her a close shave and yet
pass by her. In that case I would go down the rope
and try to hook on to the lugger where I could,
being a pretty good swimmer.”</p>

<p>“A good idea, Tom,” said Harry Goodall; “but you
forget that when we lost your weight the balloon
would suddenly spring up, and we might leave you
below. Still, I credit you with being ready for any
kind of service in order to grapple with the lugger.
The great point now,” added the aeronaut, “is to
lower the lee-board in the event of being compelled
to deflect one way or other, so we may as well do so
at once and see how it acts. You can pay away that
fore rope, my lad, as we can still draw ahead, and
check her if necessary when we like.”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t hear us do it, would they, sir?”
asked Warner.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, or else we should be equally able to hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
them. That board, you see, will cause us to sway to
starboard or to port.”</p>

<p>“Hush, sir!” said the detective, in a whisper, “I
fancied I heard a voice not far off.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right, Warner—softly,” added Trigger,
“I distinctly heard someone speaking.”</p>

<p>“And so do I,” said Harry Goodall, under his
breath. “They are straight ahead, and are doubtless
all unconscious of our proximity. We are gaining on
them,” said Goodall, after a lapse of a few seconds.
“Slack that lee-board line, Tom. Can’t you see her
sails. We must bear more south, for the fog lifts a
trifle, and it won’t do to be seen. And put your boots
and coat on, Tom; you will not have to wet yourself
after all. The great point now is whether she is the
right craft or not? Heave on this line both of you—steady,
Warner.”</p>

<p>“That gleam of sunshine will help us,” whispered
Trigger.</p>

<p>“I heard a voice just now,” said Warner, “very
much like Croft’s.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” muttered Harry Goodall. “Don’t you
see the number on her sails faintly looming in the
distance?”</p>

<p>“We’re getting pretty near them,” whispered
Warner. “Listen to what is said.”</p>

<p>“I will pay you extra, skipper, if you land me
at Havre.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“That’s Croft, the Pocket Hercules, speaking, I’ll
be sworn, sir,” said the detective.</p>

<p>“Not a word more! We’re within an ace of running
into them, but they are looking the other way.”</p>

<p>“Are you steering for Havre, skipper?” asked a
voice very like Croft’s on board the lugger.</p>

<p>“I comprend vat you say, monsieur,” said the
skipper, “but ve must vait ontil de mist rise; ve are
long vay from Dieppe, and vy you go to Havre?”</p>

<p>“That’s no business of your’s, skipper; you take
me there!” cried Croft.</p>

<p>“Oui, oui, mais mon Dieu! vat is that? A round
ship or de sun?”</p>

<p>“By jingo!” cried Croft, “that’s that cussed
balloon! Look here,” exclaimed the fugitive, “I’ll
give anyone on board a fiver for a loaded rifle.”</p>

<p>“My crew no fight or ve may get into trouble,”
cried the skipper. “Pere-haps dat is a varbalon
from my contree, it come dat vay from
the east.”</p>

<p>“I know where it comes from, skipper,” cried
Croft. “If I only had a gun—”</p>

<p>“Here you are, monsieur,” said a fierce-looking
fellow, who did not look like one of the crew. “It is
fully loaded. And I say,” he added in an undertone,
“I am taking explosives to Paris for the glorious
Anarchist cause. Will one of our little dynamite
<i>bons-bons</i> suit you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“Yes, brother of my heart,” said Croft, “and if
you can chuck it up high enough, your fortune is
made, but don’t blow yourself up in a vain attempt
that will fail. After all, it would be safer to trust
to ordinary firearms rather than these new-fangled
concerns.”</p>

<p>On hearing this conversation, Trigger at once
loaded the guns, handing the air-gun to Mr Goodall,
who was intent on thinking out a plan to check the
skipper from putting his helm up and so avoiding
the balloon.</p>

<p>Harry Goodall’s idea was to lower their grapnel a
few feet and give it a pendulum-like swing so that
it should stand a better chance, by describing a larger
area, of coming in contact with the spars and rigging.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, sir,” said Trigger, “there will be
bloodshed.”</p>

<p>“Well, we must avoid it if possible, Tom,” replied
his master.</p>

<p>“Don’t kill Croft,” said the detective; “I want
particularly to take him alive.”</p>

<p>A moment afterwards Croft and the French
Anarchist were seen to raise their guns to the
shoulder. A flash followed, and Warner was grazed
by something on the forehead, while Tom had been
hit in the leg. And the rattle on the wicker basket-work
of the car indicated that they had been fired
at with slugs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“I say this is getting a little too hot, Mr Goodall,”
cried Trigger. “Look, sir, at that French villain
climbing up to cut away our grapnel.”</p>

<p>“Shall I fetch him down with my bull-dog?”
asked Warner.</p>

<p>“I thought you wanted to take him alive?”</p>

<p>“That’s true, sir, but another fellow wants to
cut us adrift, and I shall lose them altogether.”</p>

<p>But Trigger’s blood was up, and before his
master could restrain him he had fired, and immediately
a man was seen to slip down the
rattlings.</p>

<p>“I’ve dusted him in the stern sheets, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’ve marked him, Trigger, but I hope not
seriously.”</p>

<p>Then an excited conversation took place between
the skipper and the wounded man, but the aeronauts
could not hear the actual words. But whatever they
were, their effect was that the little Anarchist dropped
some package overboard, and then, picking himself up,
he retreated with Croft behind an improvised barricade
of cases which were on the fore-deck of the
lugger, while the skipper and his crew grouped themselves
astern, evidently as non-belligerents.</p>

<p>Then Harry Goodall called on the skipper to
surrender Croft, but, to the aeronaut’s surprise, the
skipper made no reply. Thereupon Warner prepared
for further action, while Trigger popped into Bennet’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
double-barrelled breach-loader two more cartridges of
No. 8 shot.</p>

<p>Taking his cue from Croft and the Anarchist,
Goodall proceeded to hoist the lee-board over the edge
of the car, so as to be even with their opponents
when they renewed their attack, for it appeared as
though they intended to do so, as their duck guns
had been reloaded, and Croft had placed his leather
bag, which was supposed to contain the squire’s
property, in a snug place by his side; but his companion
was writhing with pain, owing to the peppering
his legs and back had received from Trigger.
Possibly he was not seriously hurt, but his vows of
vengeance on Tom Trigger and his companions, were
truly horrible to listen to. Evidently it had not
been believed that the aeronauts were able to make
such a stout retaliation.</p>

<p>Presently the loud shriek of a fog horn was heard,
as though a steamer were approaching through the
mist.</p>

<p>Croft, as if startled at the sound, decided upon immediate
action, believing probably in the badness of
his own cause, and fearing the approach of those who
might lend assistance to the aeronauts.</p>

<p>“Now or never!” he said to his fierce associate, “let
them have it,” and another volley was discharged at
the balloonists, but they had kept their bodies well
behind the board; and as Harry Goodall could just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
discern a steam vessel looming through the fog, he at
once ordered Trigger and Warner not to return the
fire, especially as someone could be distinctly heard
hailing them in English.</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy! What’s amiss?” asked someone.
“What’s all this firing about? Is there mutiny on
board?”</p>

<p>“Blowed if there ain’t a balloon hitched on to
the lugger,” exclaimed another voice before Goodall
could reply.</p>

<p>“If you will send a boat, I’ll explain matters,” said
Goodall. “What ship are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ll have a boat manned. Hold on. I
am Link, the captain. This is the <i>Retriever</i> from
London.”</p>

<p>“What! my dear old friend Link, by all that’s
wonderful. I’m Harry Goodall. Well, this is a bit
of luck and no mistake.”</p>

<p>The situation now became still more exciting, for
Croft, who heard what had been said, rushed out of
ambush, bag in hand, and looked as if he were either
going to jump overboard or throw his bag into the
sea. Hereupon, Harry Goodall immediately levelled
his air-gun and sent a pellet through Croft’s left arm,
which was extended with a swinging motion, causing
him at once to drop the bag. Then Goodall made
a dash for the deck of the lugger by slipping down a
rope, he scarcely knew how, being followed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Warner, while Trigger compensated for their loss of
weight by discharging gas very freely. The detective
at once confronted Croft, produced his warrant and
slipped on the handcuffs, while Goodall held a revolver
menacingly; as he did so, Captain Link and his
crew, who had steamed up nearer to them, witnessed
this proceeding, and a ringing cheer was given when
Harry Goodall held up for their inspection the black
bag which held the stolen cash, the deeds and other
securities.</p>

<p>The <i>Retriever’s</i> life-boat had by this time brought
Captain Link alongside the lugger, and he quickly
sprang on deck. The meeting there was naturally
one of great cordiality.</p>

<p>During their hasty consultation, the balloon had
risen clear of all surrounding obstacles to the full
length of the grapnel rope, and was swaying over
towards the steamer’s stern. But the crew gradually
hauled in the rope, in accordance with Trigger’s instructions,
while he opened the top valve.</p>

<p>“So I have just arrived in time to give you a lift
into Cherbourg, my dear Goodall,” said Link, “but
we must take this fellow Croft on board at once.
Here, Warner, you had better take off these handcuffs;
the fellow’s arms seem injured, though not
fractured, I think. He can’t escape, you know. How
about this other man?” added Captain Link, who did
not like the look of the Anarchist, and thought that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
as he had been warmly peppered in the legs and
back by Trigger’s dust shot, he might be left behind.</p>

<p>“He stay wid me,” cried the skipper. “You no
punish him more.”</p>

<p>“I have a second warrant,” said Warner, who now
had Croft in the boat.</p>

<p>“Oui, oui,” said the skipper, “but not for my contreeman.”</p>

<p>“I only wish I could meet with Croft’s master;
I’ve a word or two to say to him,” said the detective.</p>

<p>“Eh, vat you mean—Croft’s master? Is it Maester
Fallcone you mean?” asked the skipper.</p>

<p>“You shut up, skipper,” cried Croft, with a murderous
expression of face. “You have too long a
tongue.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t the skipper better come along with us
on board the <i>Retriever</i> and explain matters?” said
Captain Link.</p>

<p>“Yes, I go vit you,” observed the skipper. “I no
fear dat fellow,” pointing to Croft, already in the
boat, “nor his grand maitre.”</p>

<p>“Well, come and talk things over,” said Harry
Goodall. “But how about this Anarchist? Are you
hurt, my man?”</p>

<p>“Sacré! Mort au bourgeoisie!” was his sole reply.</p>

<p>“He no run avay; pere-haps I vant him soon,” said
the skipper. “He is a good sailor, but a fool to do vit
dy-nam-mite and bomb-shell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>“I may have to run you into Cherbourg,” said
Captain Link. “We must talk it over on
board.”</p>

<p>“See you here, monsieur capitaine,” replied the
skipper, as Croft was put below hatches on board
the <i>Retriever</i>, “you vant to meet the little man’s
maister, don’t you? Den de first ting is to let me
and the luggare go.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see that,” said Harry Goodall.</p>

<p>“Come on board, skipper, and have a glass
of Burgundy,” urged Captain Link, diplomatically.</p>

<p>“Oh, certamong monsieur capitaine, aprèz vous. I
vant to go avay in my luggare, and you vant, I tink,
Maître Fallcone to com to you; vary vell. Vat is so, is
it not?”</p>

<p>Warner, who had locked up his prisoner safely,
then joined the party in the cabin, where the
skipper was gesticulating over his wine and slapping
his forehead, as if he had conceived a bright
idea.</p>

<p>Warner’s quick brain at once realised the situation,
and, taking up a slate and pencil near him, he wrote
down these words, handing them to Mr Goodall and
the captain,—</p>

<p>“Cut short the palaver by making him a liberal
offer in cash.”</p>

<p>Captain Link, however, did not wholly approve of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
this short off-hand way of proceeding, and said to the
Frenchman,—</p>

<p>“If we take you into Cherbourg, skipper, we
could—”</p>

<p>But Goodall cut in with,—</p>

<p>“We could there come to terms about arranging an
interview with Mr Falcon, but, since time is pressing,
can’t you see your way clear to agree at once,
skipper, to accept one hundred pounds—ten on
account to-day—in consideration of fulfilling our
wishes?”</p>

<p>“Oui, oui; I do dat dis moment for I know where
Fallcone is located, and can do—vat you call it?”</p>

<p>“Lead him,” suggested Goodall.</p>

<p>“Ah, grand, monsieur. Lead him or pilot him
to exchange complements wid you—say if you tink
it vel—about tree mile from Cherbourg Harbour.”</p>

<p>“In your lugger, skipper?”</p>

<p>“No, no, in quite annudder sheep.”</p>

<p>“That will do capitally, skipper,” said Captain
Link, “but you must let us know the day and the
hour as near as possible.”</p>

<p>“I do all dat, nevare fear. I vire you or write
by poste. Au revoir,” said the Frenchman, as he
pocketed the ten pounds.</p>

<p>“Your name, I think, skipper, is Captain Ami?”</p>

<p>“Oui; Poste Restant, Dieppe.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Harry Goodall. “Well, remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
the ninety pounds shall be forthcoming on your
carrying out our bargain.”</p>

<p>“Vill dis veek suit you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; the sooner the better. You had better
address to Captain Link, the <i>Retriever</i>, Cherbourg
Harbour. Adieu!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>RECONCILIATION AND RETROSPECTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the letter from Mr William Goodall to
Squire Dove, in which the merchant promised to visit
them, proved consoling at Wedwell Hall, still the
fate of the aeronauts was the great engrossing topic
that grew in intensity hour after hour, so that reports
of the vaguest kind were eagerly caught at
by the gamekeeper and Lucy, who knew how deeply
Miss Dove especially was concerned about Harry
Goodall; nor was Lucy herself much less anxious as
to Trigger, so that she took every opportunity of
acquiring each scrap of information that she could
gather, both as to where the balloon had descended
and whether Croft had been arrested or any information
had been obtained as to his whereabouts.</p>

<p>One of the earliest, if not reliable, sources of intelligence
was generally to be met with in the person of
Doctor Peters, who was an inveterate newspaper
reader, subscribing to many of the metropolitan and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
local papers. Knowing this, Bennet, who was very
eager for news, determined to waylay the doctor.
Meeting him on the confines of the park with a
newspaper in his hand, he at once accosted him after
touching his hat,—</p>

<p>“Any stirring news this morning, sir?” asked the
gamekeeper.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s something fresh,” replied the doctor,
“though I daresay that you and others have heard it.”</p>

<p>“It will be news to me at all events,” replied
Bennet.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll read you the paragraph which the
<i>Daily Post</i> gives:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">A Fishing-Lugger’s Strange Adventure.</span>—A
remarkable report reached Dieppe yesterday that
the French lugger, No. 365, was attacked off the coast
by a party of English aeronauts, who, representing
themselves as emissaries of justice, arrested a passenger
named Croft in the name of the law. It may
be remembered that the prisoner is wanted, together
with his confederate Falcon, on various criminal
charges. Our report is furnished by the captain
of the <i>Retriever</i>, who stood by and gave assistance.
Further details will be at hand shortly!’”</p>
</div>

<p>“Well, to be sure!” cried Bennet, “that is news
indeed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>“I should just think it is, Bennet. Well, you can
take the newspaper and show it to them at the
Hall. I sha’n’t go up myself, as the squire is so
strangely incensed against me. He seems to think
I still support those miscreants; however, he would
change his mind if he would listen to a few
important details I could tell him. Just look, there
goes the postman. Follow him up, Bennet; I daresay
he may bring some startling intelligence.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the gamekeeper’s agreeable surprise
at the doctor’s change of mind, which he was
at some loss to understand, he did not waste time
in speculation, but hurried up to the Hall and found
that the newspaper paragraph had been seen and
discussed, and that its effect on the squire was the
reverse of agreeable, especially as a letter from
Newhaven was of a less sensational character. His
informant advised him not to pay much attention
to what the reporters had written as a great deal
of fiction had been mixed up with a modicum of
fact.</p>

<p>“There can be little doubt,” said the correspondent,
“that the balloon and a French lugger,
which was believed to contain Croft, were engaged,
but there was another fugitive on board, though not
Falcon, I regret to say. It is impossible at present
to say whether your property was saved or not,
though I am disposed to think that it was, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
a sharp contest, in which two of the three balloonists
were slightly wounded, although they came off the
victors in the end.”</p>

<p>Edith Dove and Miss Chain, as well as Lucy, were
naturally much depressed by the news, but the
squire, on the other hand, stoutly maintained that
there was nothing in what they had heard to cause
anxiety. In this state of affairs, the receipt of
several telegrams was joyfully welcomed.</p>

<p>Miss Dove’s was from Harry Goodall. It said,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Have reached Cherbourg and captured C. <i>en
route</i>. Hope soon to arrest F. before returning.
Excuse more at present.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Well, that’s short and sweet enough!” exclaimed
the squire. “Edith, no doubt Harry does not think
it safe to say more, fearing that the French authorities
might detain him.”</p>

<p>“Or worse, papa, he may be badly wounded and
too ill to write, and, out of consideration for my
feelings, tries to disguise the fact.”</p>

<p>“Not he, Edith. How could he continue the chase
for Falcon if he—”</p>

<p>“Well, well, let’s hope for the best. Now, dear
Miss Chain, let us hear yours.”</p>

<p>“Mine is from Captain Link, dear. There, read it
yourself.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“Just witnessed spirited, glorious engagement between
the balloon party and a French lugger. Have
caught Croft. On the track of the other. Returning
shortly.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Hurray! God bless them!” exclaimed the squire.
“But who’s that snivelling?”</p>

<p>“Lucy in the next room, papa.”</p>

<p>“Come in here, Lucy,” cried the squire. “What’s
amiss with you?”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, my telegram says that Trigger’s
wounded.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, girl, let me read it.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Croft taken with the swag. Am wounded but
nothing serious.”</p>
</div>

<p>“There’s nothing to cry about in that, Lucy,
my good girl. I daresay his wound is a mere
scratch.”</p>

<p>“And no doubt, squire,” said Miss Chain, who was
much reassured since the receipt of her telegram,
“that they had good reasons for being brief and
cautious, as they have taken their prisoners and prize
into Cherbourg.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, Miss Chain,” cried the squire. “I daresay
they have, and, of course, they have to be
cautious that they don’t give themselves away in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
the matter. The fact is, they have engaged in a
deucedly delicate matter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please, sir, do you think Tom will come back
on crutches?” asked Lucy.</p>

<p>“More likely, girl, with flying colours and lots of
prize money,” said the squire, laughingly.</p>

<p>The ladies then took a stroll in the park, taking
much comfort in each other’s society. But they were
again considerably upset by noticing on their return,
that the squire was rather agitated. Directly he
saw his daughter, he asked her, excitedly, if Lucy
could take a letter of importance to Newhaven as
Bennet could not be spared? He added that Doctor
Peters was ill and wished to see him in order to
make a communication that permitted no delay.</p>

<p>“Very well, papa, if you really must send Lucy;
and pray see the poor old doctor at once. I wonder
what he has to say?”</p>

<p>We must now turn to Hawksworth and his actions.
He had heard just enough, both at Haywards Heath
and elsewhere, about the fugitive financier and his
supposed whereabouts to induce him to have another
attempt to capture Falcon, as the detective had been
told that he was evading the police, and that Warner
had been on a wild-goose chase after him, and had
failed. So Hawksworth set out for the south coast
with the idea of redeeming his waning reputation,
and he resolved that he would leave no stone unturned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
to effect his capture, especially as he held
warrants for the arrest of the financier and for Croft,
respecting some Australian doings and other charges
relating to crimes on the high seas.</p>

<p>Hawksworth left London with his usual jaunty
air of confidence, which was one of his weak points,
and another was his susceptibility to the charms of
the fair sex. It was in endeavouring to make himself
agreeable to Miss Chain, and to ingratiate himself
with that young lady, that he made that fatal
mistake at the Crystal Palace, in fancying that
Captain Link was Filcher Falcon, merely because he
personally resembled him to some extent. However,
had he known the particulars of Warner’s pursuit
of the fugitives, he would probably have felt less
confident in his mission, which subsequent events—but
we must not anticipate.</p>

<small>TIGHTENING THE NET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the squire’s making up his mind to visit Doctor
Peters, he elected to do so privately from the park
by way of the lane. On his arrival, he found his
medical adviser reclining on an old-fashioned couch
and looking a most dejected object.</p>

<p>“I am truly sorry to see you down again with
gout,” said the squire. “Don’t move, Peters; you
must shake off this attack as soon as you can, for
I am not feeling at all well myself,” said he, selfishly.
“This robbery has greatly upset me. Of course you
heard of it?”</p>

<p>“I did, squire, and wish to speak to you of a loss
I have myself had.”</p>

<p>“I hope that you have not also fallen a victim to
those rascals, doctor?”</p>

<p>“I have, though, and it occurred on the same night
that we were all in the park, soon after Falcon and
Croft entered your library, when, so far as I can
make out by Maria’s evidence, the scoundrels finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
up here. At last, squire, I have been convinced that
my girl’s statement was only too true.”</p>

<p>“What led to the discovery, Peters?”</p>

<p>“The fact of not having been able to find the key
of my skeleton case, though I searched high and
low.”</p>

<p>“The same in which Falcon hid himself when
Warner paid you a visit?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the identical one, and, worse luck, my cash
box was inside. I never gave it a thought when I
put the rascal there. Well, the villain’s sharp eyes
must have ‘spotted’ it, for it has disappeared. What
a plausible devil the fellow is to be sure—so fair
spoken, and, egad! even liberal at times. I don’t
wonder that he entertained some ideas about aerial
flight.”</p>

<p>“You must excuse my laughing, doctor.”</p>

<p>“You may well do so, squire, though to me it is
no laughing matter, I can assure you, for I had
drawn out of the bank some years’ savings to entrust
him with, as you had done with your capital,
but I hung fire in letting him have mine for a while;
in fact, I had only handed it over a day before the
balloonists arrived.”</p>

<p>“What made you do so, Peters?”</p>

<p>“Why, your own great faith in him before the
real and unexpected aerial visitors came.”</p>

<p>“But afterwards you believed in him, doctor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“I defended Falcon in his absence, but, while
doing so, I never supposed that he had robbed you
and me too. But, alas, when I could not find the
key of my skeleton case, I broke it open and found
that I had been plundered, and, without doubt, by
those rascals after they had shot at Mr Goodall and
entered your library.”</p>

<p>“Well, believe me, you have my sincerest sympathy;
but loss it shall never be to you if I can help
it. And though we were opposed for a time in our
views about this rascal, we are at length of one mind
as to making haste to discover Falcon’s hiding-place.
I am told that you have given notice yourself to the
police of his treachery, so that you are entirely exonerated
from the slightest suspicion of collusion in
any way with him.”</p>

<p>“Beyond that silly telegram I sent to Sydenham,
when I vainly fancied that it would bring him back
to you, squire.”</p>

<p>“You clearly mistook your man, doctor, and so did
I, and if you had heard all that the aeronauts said
in disfavour of Falcon, you would not have been
so—”</p>

<p>“Pig-headed—that’s the word, squire. I can see
it now, but feel that it is never too late to mend.”</p>

<p>“God bless you, Peters, and speedily restore you;
but rouse yourself, old friend, for who knows but
what your property and mine may not yet be brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
back to us through the brave exertions of Harry
Goodall and his friends.”</p>

<p>“I trust they will, and now allow me, squire, to
thank you sincerely for this visit; it has eased my
mind and will make me better able to bear this
attack of gout, if not to cure it.”</p>

<p>“One word at parting, doctor, I have not long
heard that Falcon has been seen on board a boulder
boat, and a later addition is that he was taken up
afterwards by a smack with a view of working round
to Folkestone or Boulogne. Lucy has gone off to
Newhaven with a letter, and to gather further intelligence.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, I hope he will be caught before long,
squire. Good-bye, good-bye.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lucy had reached Lewes in a light trap.
Directly she alighted, she made her way to the platform
from which the Newhaven train started, and,
while descending the steps, she was asked by a gentlemanly-looking
person, evidently in a great state of
excitement, “If he was in time for the tidal train?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, plenty, sir, and to spare,” said Lucy.
“It won’t leave for twenty minutes, though I don’t
really know if it is the boat train.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad,” said the gentleman, “for I am
rather in a dilemma.”</p>

<p>“You are not the only traveller in that state, sir,”
replied Lucy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“No, I expect not. The fact is, I want to be in
Newhaven as soon as I can, and I wanted, before
doing so, to visit a park near here where a balloon
descended some short time since.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Wedwell Park, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it. How far is it from here?”</p>

<p>“Some distance, sir; you would have to take a
conveyance.”</p>

<p>“Then I will go on to Newhaven, but, if I am not
taking too great a liberty, might I ask if there is
any definite news of a man named Falcon?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir, I can give you the latest information.”</p>

<p>“You can!” repeated her interrogator, with
pleasurable astonishment expressed in every feature
in his face. “What a bit of luck my meeting
you!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are a detective?” said Lucy.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I am. I will be fair and frank with
you. My name is Hawksworth.”</p>

<p>“But, sir, possibly my latest information may be
of little use to you.”</p>

<p>“Let me judge of that; the smallest clue sometimes
leads to a capture.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I have been told that Mr Falcon has
been seen on board a boulder boat, and that he was
then transferred to a smack bound for Folkestone
or Boulogne.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>“Really, your information is of the greatest importance,
but you are not ‘kidding’ me, I hope?
But no! you look too straightforward to do that.
You won’t be offended if I ask your name and
address, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, sir, I come from Wedwell Park, and
my name is Lucy.”</p>

<p>“It is a pleasure to have made your acquaintance,”
replied Hawksworth, gallantly. “Here! I say guard,
what time does the train for Hastings go?”</p>

<p>“In about ten minutes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then I must say good-bye,” said Hawksworth,
taking off his hat. “I hope to meet you soon again.”</p>

<p>“Willingly, sir.”</p>

<p>When Lucy had ensconced herself in a railway
carriage for Newhaven, she was glad to be alone,
for her face was flushed, and she began to have
misgivings as to whether she had done the correct
thing to tell a stranger what she had heard. At the
same time, if the man was a detective—and she had
heard Warner speak of such a name as Hawksworth—she
had done the right thing at the right time,
for she was eager that Falcon should be in custody.
Just as Lucy was consoling herself with these thoughts,
the guard’s whistle was blown and the train began
to move. At the same moment, two men rushed
into the carriage at some risk, though they apologised
to Lucy, as the sole occupant, for causing her the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
least alarm. Seeing that the younger limped a little,
she replied politely that she was not frightened at
all, and trusted he had not hurt himself in getting in;
but he assured her his lameness was not due to any
such cause, but to a wound he had got when at sea.
The stouter man seemed displeased at his companion’s
effusiveness and checked him with a frown, while he
addressed some observations to him in indifferent
English, but Lucy understood him to say,—</p>

<p>“Nevare moind, mate, ve no fight on board de
new ship <i>Panthere</i>, vhich is no luggare, I can tell
you dat.”</p>

<p>The last spokesman looked like a seafaring man,
who might be a captain. Presently his companion
drew nearer to Lucy, but not offensively, and asked
her if she had not been speaking to a gentleman at
Lewes.</p>

<p>“I had seen the gentleman for the first time,” said
Lucy.</p>

<p>“He go to Hastings, I tink,” said the skipper-looking
person.</p>

<p>Lucy at once became very uncommunicative, but
the younger man hazarded the remark that he
thought the gentleman was in their train.</p>

<p>“Oh, vel, ve vil carry good news now on board,”
said the stouter mariner, who took a good pull at
his cognac flask and handed the bottle to his mate,
who finished what was left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>At the Newhaven town station, these passengers
got out, but Lucy went on to the further station, as
she had to see the harbour-master, but she noticed
that when the men got out, they seemed to speak to
a middle-aged female and an elderly old lady, who
seemed rather bewildered, and Lucy concluded that
they were all going on board the <i>Panther</i>, which the
sailors had alluded to. Lucy had a good stare at
the old lady, as she was so uncommonly like Miss
Chain’s mother, but she could not settle that doubtful
point by speaking to her, as the train began to
move on, so that the girl came to the conclusion that
she had been mistaken.</p>

<p>At the harbour-master’s office, Lucy delivered her
letter and stated that the squire and Miss Dove were
very anxious as to the safety of the aerial voyagers.
She was informed that they had not left Cherbourg,
as some hitch had delayed them for a day or two.
At the same time, said the harbour master, they
might return unexpectedly. Lucy was then asked if
the Doves were acquainted with a French captain,
who was in the habit of visiting Newhaven, and who
was supposed to be known to Mr Falcon. Lucy
replied that she did not think so.</p>

<p>“I can tell you positively,” said the harbour master,
“that the balloonists are safe, but I cannot tell you
more at present beyond this, that Falcon is still baffling
us all. There was a rumour, as I told the squire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
that he had gone to Folkestone or Boulogne, but I
now believe that he is secreted somewhere near here.
Do you think that the squire or his daughter could
come over in case of necessity?”</p>

<p>“I daresay, sir, that Miss Dove and her friend, Miss
Chain, might be able to see you, but the squire is not
very well, having been much upset by the robbery.”</p>

<p>“In that case you had better not repeat all I have
told you, but rather leave my letter to speak for itself.
And you will do well to hasten back.”</p>

<p>As Lucy was leaving the office she caught sight, for
the second time that day, of a face which seemed
familiar to her. But recognition was made difficult
by reason of the individual wearing a blue blouse,
like a working man from Normandy. However, he
apparently had no doubts, for he sprang towards Lucy
and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me, Lucy?” said the foreign-looking
man.</p>

<p>“Why, as I live, it is Simon Warner. Well, I am
glad to see you, and how are Tom and Mr Goodall?
Are they with you?”</p>

<p>“No; I am only over for an hour on most important
business. Trigger is all right now, and so is Mr
Goodall, but I have not long to stay here, for I am
going back to Cherbourg by the next boat.”</p>

<p>“And how are Tom’s wounds? And hasn’t your
face been injured, Mr Warner?” asked Lucy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“Oh, never mind that; and as to Tom, he’s getting
on all right.”</p>

<p>At this moment, Warner was summoned into the
presence of the station-master, but before he left, he
begged Lucy to give his duty to the squire and Miss
Edith, while he confided a special message to the
cook.</p>

<p>Lucy’s trip had been not an altogether uneventful
one. She was particularly mystified by Warner’s
being at Newhaven in disguise, yet she presumed
there was more going on than was dreamt of in her
humble philosophy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>DECOYED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> latest news delivered by Lucy to Squire Dove,
though designed to allay his distress of mind, was
futile as to its effect, but Edith and Miss Chain were
rejoiced to hear that the doctor and the squire were
now reconciled. A missive of much stranger nature,
however, arrived the next morning, and purported to
emanate from the harbour-master’s office at Newhaven.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Will Squire Dove kindly send his carriage over at
one o’clock to-morrow to meet the Company’s agent at
the new bridge, when Miss Dove and her companion
will be in time to meet their friends from Cherbourg.
No reply is expected, but the arrival of the ladies at
the time specified, will be relied upon, when they will
be met and conducted on board a steamer. In haste,
to save the post.”</p>
</div>

<p>The squire was himself anxious to go, but his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
daughter prevailed upon him not to do so, owing to
his health.</p>

<p>On the ladies arriving at the new bridge, they were
met by a fashionably-dressed gentleman whom they
supposed was the Company’s agent. He escorted the
ladies with much politeness on board a fine-looking
vessel lying close to the wharf, but higher up than the
place where the steamers generally start from. They
were then invited to the saloon, where luncheon was
ready prepared for them. Then excusing himself on
the ground that he had business to transact with their
new captain and mate, he left them to their luncheon,
stating that he would return as soon as he possibly
could.</p>

<p>The steward was very attentive as he waited at
table, and chatted with the ladies in an affable though
perfectly respectful manner.</p>

<p>“Yes, ladies, we shall be slowly moving down the
river to meet the vessel which, I understand, has your
party of friends on board.”</p>

<p>“But we are surely passing out of the harbour,” remarked
Miss Chain, in accents of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Just so, ladies,” said the steward; “the vessel has
to be turned, and we may run out a short way to be
able to swing her safely.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that most unusual?” exclaimed Miss Dove.</p>

<p>“Not with a vessel of this class,” explained the
steward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>“Oh, dear,” cried Miss Chain, “but we are passing
into rough water.”</p>

<p>“There is a slight swell, ladies. It is caused by
the tide. She will be steadier directly. Perhaps you
would prefer to lie down?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, we would sooner go on deck,” cried
Edith Dove, not clearly understanding their position.</p>

<p>“If you ladies just keep quiet for one minute,” said
the steward, “I will step up and ask the captain how
far they are going to run out to meet the Dieppe boat
before turning.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t this a passenger boat?” asked Miss
Chain.</p>

<p>“Well, no, not exactly,” said the steward, with a
smile which he seemed trying to suppress.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened, for a groan and a
kind of hysterical scream were heard, and seemed to
issue from a cabin not far away, as though some lady
passenger was ill on board. And at the same moment
a stewardess came into the saloon and tried to persuade
Miss Dove and Miss Chain to lie down, and invited
them to take some decoction, which she extolled as a
certain specific against sea-sickness.</p>

<p>“Thank you, nothing of that sort. I really don’t
understand where we are going, or what they are
doing with the ship.”</p>

<p>“I am a stranger myself to the ship,” said the
stewardess; “in fact, most of us are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Do pray explain yourself more clearly, it will be
better for you. There is, we think,” cried Miss Dove,
in a state of alarm, “some mistake or mystery about
our being here.”</p>

<p>Then another groan was heard.</p>

<p>“Poor, dear lady, she is bad; I must go to her,”
said the stewardess, as she left the saloon.</p>

<p>Then Edith Dove and Miss Chain made a rush for
the deck to ascertain what was going on, but the
steward, however, who was descending the companion
ladder, begged the ladies to keep below for a short
while, stating that the captain was himself coming
down. Shortly afterwards he appeared, accompanied
by the mate. Both seemed to be Frenchmen, and the
mate the only one who could speak English intelligibly.</p>

<p>“We are running out a longer distance than we
thought of doing before we turn, as we wish to sight
the Dieppe steamer before doing so.”</p>

<p>This statement did not at all satisfy the ladies, particularly
as the man had a repulsive appearance,
whilst he limped as though he was not quite sober.
However, he soon moved off in search of more drink.
Then the captain, touching his hat most respectfully,
handed a folded paper, on which was written in English,—“I
am Captain Ami, and if you have faith in me
no harm will befall you.” Then, saluting the ladies,
he left them without another word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>But this announcement was so strange and unaccountable
that Edith Dove and Miss Chain, though to
some extent relieved, were still in an alarming state
of fright lest this Captain Ami might be an agent, not
of the Harbour Company, but of the man they most
dreaded, namely Falcon.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we further test this man and insist on
going on deck?” said Miss Chain.</p>

<p>“Certainly, dear, we will go.”</p>

<p>And no hindrance was made to their doing this.
When they stood on deck, they looked round them,
and discovered that they were already some distance
from the shore. Scanning the people on board, they
were at once attracted by the presence of a slouching
figure, who kept entirely in the fore part of the vessel,
while the captain and the mate chatted together near
the wheel.</p>

<p>“Edith, dear, I can’t take my eyes off that horrid-looking
man in the fore part of the vessel, who seems
trying to avoid our inspection. Although he looks as
dark as a mulatto, I believe it is none other than that
arch-fiend Falcon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Chain, if that is so, we are undone, and
you may depend that we have been kidnapped. That
letter must have been a forgery, and not from the
harbour-master’s agent at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, these men will not surely dare to offer us
any insult. Perhaps they are holding us to ransom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
trying to make terms so as to escape prosecution for
the robbery of the securities. One thing is certain,
we must not show the slightest sign of fear.”</p>

<p>“This vessel,” said Miss Dove, “is evidently a hired
yacht.”</p>

<p>“And going,” added Miss Chain, “goodness knows
where. Ah! there is that cry again from that poor
woman! By the way, who can she be? Is she also
in their power? Do you know, dear, that her voice
seems oddly familiar to me. If it were not quite impossible,
I would say it was my mother’s.”</p>

<p>“I told you, dear,” said Miss Dove, “that we had
more trouble before us. What will my poor, dear
father do, when we fail to return?”</p>

<p>“I am sure that God will help us, Miss Dove. Oh,
listen to that poor sea-sick creature below.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you slip down in the saloon and speak to
the stewardess about her, my dear Miss Chain?”</p>

<p>“We ought not to separate,” said her companion.
“By the way, how are we off for money?”</p>

<p>“I have very little,” said Miss Dove.</p>

<p>“Suppose we try and get down in the saloon, then.
I don’t suppose they will keep us below, or exercise
restraint if we do not seem to be aware that we are
entrapped.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; let us venture, Miss Chain.”</p>

<p>When they descended, they found that the stewardess
was fully expecting their arrival, and had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
in and out of the ladies’ cabin preparing for them, for
there was a lumpy sea on and a nasty look outside
the south coast in the direction they were going.
They had not been down below many minutes before
the groans of the poor sufferer were again heard.
Then Miss Chain came close to Miss Dove and whispered
to her,—</p>

<p>“Make some excuse to get the stewardess on deck
with you; say that you want her arm to steady you as
you can’t stop below. Say anything you like, but get
the woman out of the way, for I intend to solve the
mystery of those distressful cries myself, and learn the
poor creature’s story.”</p>

<p>It was some little time before Miss Dove could
carry out this stratagem, but at length she succeeded.
They had no sooner disappeared, than Miss Chain approached
the cabin where the sick woman lay. She
had been locked in, but the key had been carelessly
left in the door. No words can express Miss Chain’s
horror and astonishment on beholding her dear mother,
who, putting her finger to her lips, begged her to
speak low.</p>

<p>“I have been trying for some time to draw your
attention, dear,” said Mrs Chain, “as I heard you in
the saloon, and thank God for this chance of telling
you that I am sure we are kidnapped, no doubt by
that wretch Falcon, who would not hesitate to carry
us out to sea and even take our lives. Be quick, dear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
and take this leather bag, for it contains money which
you may want. It is part of the proceeds of the fifty-pound
cheque Miss Dove most kindly sent me a while
ago, when she heard the story of our losses through
Falcon. My idea is that you should bribe the stewardess,
and also terrify her by informing her that Miss
Dove is the daughter of the squire, who is a magistrate.”</p>

<p>“My dear mother, how providential is this meeting,
and how singularly opportune is Miss Dove’s present
to you at a time when it may assist us and her too.
But how came you here, mother?”</p>

<p>“I was told in a letter that I was to meet you and
Miss Dove on board a yacht. But when I got on
board yesterday, I discovered that I had been entrapped.
Then, in my hearing, Falcon told the
stewardess that if I attempted to communicate with
anyone who might come on board I should be put down
in the fore hold. Fearing that he would carry out his
threat, I had recourse to pretending to be desperately
sea-sick, so as to give him the impression that I was too
ill to notice anything around me.”</p>

<p>“But have they hired this yacht for a cruise, or for
what purpose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know, dear child; but from what the
mate told me after I was entrapped yesterday, they
are going over to Havre first of all to meet a friend
who had preceded them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“I dare not stay longer now, dear mother, as the
stewardess will be coming down. But keep up heart, for
I have some idea that we may have a friend on board
after all. Hush! I can’t say more, someone is coming.”</p>

<p>It was quite excusable of Miss Chain after such an
exciting episode to throw herself on a lounge, and she
thought it might allay suspicion if she affected indisposition.</p>

<p>When Miss Dove entered the cabin, she was looking
very pale and anxious, but Miss Chain made her a sign
not to address her at present. Thinking the ladies were
both ill, the stewardess again strongly recommended
her marine cordial, as she called it.</p>

<p>“You need not be suspicious of it. I will prepare it
in your presence, ladies. It will do neither of us any
harm, I assure you, and I will drink some of it myself
first, if you like.”</p>

<p>“You must not suppose that we mistrust you,
stewardess,” said Miss Chain, who had aroused herself.
“We are intending to make you a liberal present
if you are kind and true to us, and it may pay you
better to study our comfort and safety, than to oblige
others on board of this ship. Perhaps you don’t
know that this young lady is a magistrate’s daughter,
and that, when she is found to be missing, this vessel
will be pursued, and all confederates in these criminal
proceedings of kidnapping will be brought to justice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, lor’, miss, I’m no confederate, but only a hired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
servant. There, come into this other cabin, where we
shall not be overheard.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Miss Chain, “if you will not mind
if we have a few words there alone first.”</p>

<p>“By all means, ladies. That cabin is entirely at your
disposal. No one will interrupt you there, and in the
meantime, I will see after my other charge. But I
hope you won’t think badly of <i>me</i>,” went on the garrulous
woman, “for I’m not mixed up with these
parties as have hired the yacht. I was told it was
simply an elopement, and that I should be well paid
for my services.”</p>

<p>“But can’t you see,” said Miss Chain, “that it is a
vile kidnapping affair?”</p>

<p>“Oh, good Lord! And me a respectable Sussex
woman. What a fool I was not to have made inquiries
before I ventured on board the old <i>Panther</i>.”</p>

<p>“Is that her name?” asked Miss Dove.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss, but please to have your private talk at
once, so that I can see you before the bad weather
comes on. I’m told the glass is falling very fast, and
that they are preparing for a rough night of it.”</p>

<p>It did not take Miss Chain very long to reveal the
discovery she had made to Edith Dove, who was
much shocked to find that Miss Chain’s mother was
imprisoned on board in a separate cabin. She was
much affected when her companion offered to return
to her the bag of gold and notes, part of the cheque<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
her kindness of heart had prompted her to send to
Mrs Chain.</p>

<p>“You said, dear, it would be turned to a good and
useful account. How wonderful are the ways of
Providence. This proof of it inspires me with hope,
but you must be cashier. Now tell me, Miss Chain,
don’t you think it would be good policy to give the
stewardess, say, five pounds, <i>i.e.</i>, unless you see some
other way of turning this godsend to better account,
as your tact and judgment are superior to mine. And
do, if we can manage it, let me see your mother, for
we may meet for the first and last time, if this bloodthirsty
monster is bent on our destruction.”</p>

<p>“We must work together to prevent such an awful
catastrophe as you and my poor mother picture, Miss
Dove. But, dear me, how rough it is getting.”</p>

<p>The stewardess, on reappearing, said she was not
sorry that a storm was brewing, as Mr Filcher, the
party who had engaged the yacht, would remain
probably on deck longer than he might have done
if it had been calm, as he expected it to be.</p>

<p>“But you know him, ladies, I have no doubt. Please
to lie down, for I hear him on the companion; he is
coming down to have a drink, and perhaps to see
where you are. If he thinks you are sleeping, it
will be better for all of us.”</p>

<p>After Falcon, with an unsteady gait, had partaken
of a glass of brandy and water, he spoke in a subdued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
voice to the steward, and said that it was not
fit weather for ladies to be on deck, and he was
not over well pleased with the skipper’s seamanship,
so that he would like to be near him, as it looked
very stormy outside.</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. Please to mind our companion
steps, Mr Filcher, as they are awfully steep. You
will excuse me calling your attention to it, as I
knew a man on board the <i>Neptune</i>, a full-rigged
ship in which I once sailed, who, I was given to
understand, was pitched down the companion in a
gale of wind and broke his neck.”</p>

<p>“There was an end of him, then,” cried Falcon,
with a sneer. “He can tell no tales. However, you
can finish about him next call, for I don’t feel very
well in this atmosphere.”</p>

<p>“Too close for you, sir, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Almost too hot down here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel it so myself, sir.”</p>

<p>“Don’t suppose you do. Why, it blows stiffer than
ever.”</p>

<p>Having had recourse several times to her “marine
cordial,” the stewardess found no difficulty in getting
off to sleep; indeed, her stertorous breathing in
the adjoining cabin soon assured Miss Chain and
Miss Dove that they might venture to visit Mrs
Chain in her cabin unobserved once more; but for
a time the dread of falling down, and the bare idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
of the stewardess being awake, kept them from
active exertion. Still, if that frightful snore they
were assailed by was real and no sham, they could
both creep along the carpeted floor and say a word
or two to the poor old lady. And this they did, and
were much encouraged by each other’s society. One
thing they determined upon, and that was not to
venture on deck, believing that Falcon entertained
designs on their lives. They argued that he could
easily pitch them overboard during the darkness of
the night and the fury of the gale and no one be
wiser, their disappearance being easily accounted for
on the supposition that they had been washed overboard.</p>

<p>Another hour at least passed, when nought was
heard save the noise of the storm and the snores
of the stewardess. They listened with constant
dread lest anyone should approach their cabin.
Indeed, they began to indulge in the hope that they
might safely get some sleep, when they were aroused
by a tremendous noise as of something falling
heavily. The steward, bewildered, rushed from his
berth and called for help. Several sailors, with the
captain, descended to find their employer nearly unconscious.
Evidently he had disregarded the steward’s
advice of being careful, and had pitched down the
companion in his half-muddled condition. Falcon
was lifted up and placed on a lounge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>“Is there no doctor on board?” asked Miss Dove,
imploringly.</p>

<p>“No, miss,” replied the steward.</p>

<p>“Would a restorative be of any use?” asked Miss
Chain.</p>

<p>“No, no, he too much cognac had,” said the
captain, who was feeling Falcon’s pulse; and after
doing so for some time, he said, “I tink he not
live long. Ve must take him somevere; he no
speak.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t that old lady be moved,” asked Miss
Chain.</p>

<p>“Sans doubt,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said the stewardess, “I’ll put
the old lady into the large cabin with these ladies,
<i>i.e.</i>, if they don’t object.”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly not, we should be glad to have
her company.”</p>

<p>The question then arose as to what they were
going to do. Captain Ami said,—</p>

<p>“Ve must go ahead stead-dy till daylight come—den
pere-haps ve see some ship or get doctere from
Cherbourg if he live. Aftere dat ve go back to
Eengland.”</p>

<p>Naturally it was with unspeakable delight that
the ladies heard the captain say, “Ve must go back
to Eengland.” Then they recollected his own words
to them, which were, “To have faith in him.” Yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
the thought would obtrude itself on their minds
that Falcon’s fall down the ladder might not have
been quite such an accident as they had at first
judged it to be.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>A DISAPPEARANCE AND A REAPPEARANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Directly</span> Edith and Miss Chain were on board the
<i>Panther</i>, the Doves’ carriage put up at the Bridge
Hotel in Newhaven, in compliance with an order from
the mate of the yacht <i>Panther</i>, who further instructed
the coachman where to wait with the carriage after
the horses had been baited.</p>

<p>When two full hours had elapsed, the coachman felt
so anxious about his ladies that he returned to the
wharf to look after them, and was, of course, astonished
to notice that the vessel had vanished, but,
observing a wharfinger, he asked if he knew where
the steamer had gone.</p>

<p>“Gone,” he said, with a knowing twinkle in his
eye, “very likely to Normandy; it’s a runaway match,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” replied the coachman,
whose temper was rising. “Don’t poke fun at
me, or you’ll find yourself in the wrong box.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“Well, if that isn’t an elopement or a case of kidnapping,
I’m much deceived. The fact is, that blooming
<i>Panther</i> was thought to be a bit suspicious like,
and if I were you, I’d just look up the harbour
master,” said Blucher Gray.</p>

<p>“Why, man,” cried the coachman, “you’re all at
sea; my ladies came expressly to see some gentleman
coming from Cherbourg or Dieppe.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the parties who went up in a balloon?
Lor’ bless you, I know ’em well, and helped to
start them from Bishopstone when a detective joined
’em. But don’t you know, coachman,” said Blucher
Gray, for it was none other than he, “that there’s no
boat due yet?”</p>

<p>“My good man,” replied the coachman, “you will
drive me mad if you say much more.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s my opinion that you have been hoaxed,
and I believe I’ve been served out myself. You see
that man coming in a fly, he’s Dick Trimmons. I’ll
speak to him; we shall hear something more perhaps.
Hi! Trimmons,” cried Blucher Gray; “hold on a
minute with your trap, and tell us what you know
about that queer craft the <i>Panther</i>, and where she
has gone to.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t know she was gone,” said Dick Trimmons.
“I brought over this morning your lodger, that black
devil of a man with his big black spectacles, from
Seaford.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“And where is he now, Dick, eh? I suppose you
know the coachman here? He has lost his ladies;
they come from Wedwell Park.”</p>

<p>“Lost his ladies! You don’t mean that?”</p>

<p>“I do, indeed,” cried the Doves’ coachman. “The
fact is, I’m mighty anxious about them.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” cried Blucher Gray, “here comes the
harbour master and one or two others; they have
heard something’s up, I’ll lay a wager.”</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, sir, but didn’t you ask my ladies
to come over and meet the balloon gentlemen on their
way back from Cherbourg, sir?” said the coachman,
addressing the harbour master.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, coachman,” replied he, quite astounded.
“But why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, because Miss Dove and her friend went
on board the steam yacht <i>Panther</i>, thinking, I believe,
to meet you and their friends.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m afraid there’s been foul play. However,
I will immediately wire across and send out a tug,
though I fear it is too late to stop them. By the
way, Trimmons, who was that queer-looking man you
have been driving over from Seaford lately? He’s
stone blind, they say.”</p>

<p>“My wife’s lodger, sir,” answered Gray.</p>

<p>“But where has he gone now?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly the very point we’re discussing,”
said Trimmons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>“I can see it all,” cried the harbour master; “we’re
all completely done. The fellow was that rascal
Falcon in disguise, and he has carried off Miss Dove
and her friend, God knows where. Well, it’s no use
your stopping here, coachman, you had better
make the best of your way home to Wedwell
Park. I wish I could go with you to break the
matter to the squire. However, I’ll send my confidential
clerk.”</p>

<p>“This scoundrel Falcon owes my wife for his lodgings,”
remarked Gray, as the three walked towards the
stables.</p>

<p>“And me,” cried Trimmons, “for a lot of journeys
to and from Seaford, which he has not paid yet. I
thought he was a millionaire, and had lost his sight
by pulling in so much cash.”</p>

<p>“By golly,” said Blucher Gray, “it looks as if he
could see far enough. It’s us who were blind. I was
never taken in so in all my life. Hullo! here comes
Mr Strive, who, like us, saw the balloonists off from
Bishopstone. How are you, Mr Strive? There’s bad
news stirring, I regret to say, but we will tell you
about it at the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Nothing happened to the aeronauts, I hope?” asked
the ex-chief officer.</p>

<p>“No, they’re all right, but Squire Dove’s daughter
and her companion are carried off by that swindler
Falcon, in the <i>Panther</i> steam yacht, as we believe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
and the wretch has made off owing money right and
left, too.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so?” cried Mr Strive.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” asked the squire, as the
carriage entered Wedwell Park, for the grave faces of
the coachman and of the harbour-master’s clerk, at
once suggested some mishap, while the absence of the
ladies added to his anxiety.</p>

<p>“Let me introduce myself,” replied the occupant of
the carriage. “I am the harbour-master’s representative,
and wish to state that a steam yacht went out
unexpectedly at high water, and we fear that Miss
Dove and her companion must have been, by some
strange mistake, on board her at the time. We have
sent out a tug, and wired to the French coast, as the
<i>Panther</i> people with your ladies, squire, may have
gone out to meet the Dieppe passenger boat.”</p>

<p>“What in the name of fortune,” cried the squire,
“had my daughter to do with a steam yacht? And
do have the goodness to tell me whether your people
invited the ladies over to Newhaven Bridge at twelve
o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Yes, these,” remarked Doctor Peters, who had
joined the squire, “are most important questions.”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know,” replied the puzzled clerk.</p>

<p>“Is it possible,” exclaimed the squire, “that this
monster has outwitted us all, and robbed us besides?
I can see now the meaning of Warner’s telegram to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
Edith, which arrived two hours after the carriage left.
Here, read it, doctor, for I am feeling faint.”</p>

<p>“Yes, squire, I’ll do so while you rest. It says,—‘I
warn the ladies and the squire not to go near Newhaven.’”</p>

<p>“What a pity that telegram came so late,” exclaimed
the squire, so feebly that it was evident he was seriously
ill.</p>

<p>In another minute he would have fallen down in
a fainting fit, if Doctor Peters’s quick eye had not
noticed the change, and, running to the squire’s
assistance, he placed him on a lounge, while the requisite
remedies were forthwith administered under
Doctor Peters’s personal superintendence. It was
fortunate that he was sufficiently well to diagnose and
treat the attack, but he immediately called in from
Lewes medical help, because, after a partial revival, the
heart’s action of the squire continued very weak.</p>

<p>Mr Penfold and many other friends who had ascertained
the actual position of affairs had afforded the
squire all the consolation that they possibly could in his
distress, when a letter arrived from Mr William Goodall,
to say that he was coming next day with some good
news. This had quite a magic effect on the squire, as he
construed the letter to imply that Goodall had seen, or
heard some cheering tidings of Miss Dove and Miss
Chain. So Doctor Peters and the rest of the household
kept up this delusive idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>However, the hope and faith this belief inspired in
the mind of the squire was excusably encouraged, and
to foster it, preparations were set on foot to give a
warm reception to Mr William Goodall, including an
impromptu day of rejoicing. Bennet was therefore
told to provide what amount of sport and diversion he
could. The village band and one from Lewes were
ordered, and tents were erected in preparation.</p>

<p>On the following morning, when the squire, who
was nearly himself again, and his friends had been
amusing themselves in the punts on the fish-pond, a
shriek was heard, coming from the direction of the
gamekeeper’s cottage, and Mrs Bennet was seen standing
outside, looking as pale as death, while she pointed
towards a quiet, gentlemanly-looking man, who was
approaching the Hall. Squire Dove, whose eyes were
steadfastly fixed on this figure, exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“If I were a believer in ghosts, doctor, I should say
that, for the first time in my life, I had seen one.”</p>

<p>“Ay, how extremely like Henry Goodall who was
drowned that stranger is!”</p>

<p>While the squire and Doctor Peters were agreed on
this point, Mrs Bennet drew near to explain that the
gentleman who had so alarmed her, and who looked
the very image of William Goodall’s brother who died
at sea, frightened her by suddenly alighting from a
carriage in the lower road, and said that his brother
William, the other occupant of the carriage, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
going round to the Hall, but that he had come in by
the cottage gate so as not to frighten the squire until
his brother William had gone in advance to announce
that he, Henry, was not drowned as had been reported.
It was this unexpected news from a supposed defunct
man that had made Mrs Bennet scream.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed!” said the squire, “there comes
William Goodall from his carriage, and now the two
brothers are standing shoulder to shoulder as if they
were debating what they should do. This is a very
remarkable incident,” added the squire, “for yonder
we get another proof of how we have been swindled
by Falcon.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t allude to his name, squire, unless the
Goodalls do so first. See, they are coming down to
meet us,” cried the doctor. “Let us pause a moment
and meet them half way, squire.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>REUNION AND HAPPINESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the squire and Doctor Peters drew nearer, Henry
Goodall advanced with extended hand towards them.
Seeing this, his brother and the doctor held back for a
moment, to notice what effect the unexpected appearance
of Henry Goodall would have on their host, and
then the party all shook hands heartily.</p>

<p>“Welcome back in the flesh,” said the squire. “Welcome
to Wedwell Park. You bring us tidings of my
daughter and her companion as well as of the aeronauts.
No? I had hoped you might have met them, for you
must know that they are missing. My daughter will
sadly regret not being here to receive you.”</p>

<p>“That I am sure of,” replied Henry Goodall. “And
your kind words are doubly gratifying after the adventures
I have had, but that is too long a story to
tell you now, especially if you are concerned as to the
safety of your child.”</p>

<p>“Yes, excuse me,” cried the squire. “I’m perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
too anxious to know all, and forget my dear old
friend. How bewildered you must feel on this occasion.
But do let us move towards the tents on the
lawn and sit down.”</p>

<p>At this moment Lucy was seen approaching with a
telegram.</p>

<p>“Excuse my reading it,” said the squire, politely, to
his guests; “perhaps it is about the aeronauts. Yes, I
was right. It is from Newhaven, and says,—‘Your
daughter, Miss Chain and the aeronauts all on their
way to Wedwell Park.’ Ay, thank God for that,”
cried the squire. “Here, Lucy, give this to Bennet, and
let everyone know the good news. You will soon see
your son, Mr Goodall, and I shall once more behold
my daughter!”</p>

<p>This short but touching announcement was somewhat
enigmatical, so far as the brothers Goodall were
concerned, so the squire hurriedly gave them an
account of the startling events which had been happening
during the last few days.</p>

<p>The news of the return of the aeronauts had evidently
rapidly circulated, for considerable excitement
was apparent among the household servants and the
tenantry.</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed the doctor, “don’t you hear the
band playing ‘The Conquering Hero comes?’”</p>

<p>“Who is the hero?” asked the Sydney merchant.</p>

<p>“Why, your son, Harry Goodall, of course,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
the squire, “though no doubt your own heroic deeds
equally deserve this ovation.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, squire, you flatter me too greatly.”</p>

<p>The meeting which took place in front of the Hall
can be better imagined than described, for when Edith
Dove and the squire embraced, as did Goodall, senior,
with his son Harry, there arose such cheering that
the village bells could scarcely be heard pealing, nor
the Babel of congratulations which filled the air, so
glad were folk to welcome them all back to Wedwell
Park. Presently a move was made to the tents, where
a cold collation had been provided. After the viands
had been done justice to, and numerous toasts had
been drunk, everyone seemed as anxious to give information
of their various adventures as the rest were
desirous of hearing them.</p>

<p>Henry Goodall was the first called on to narrate the
episodes of his voyage, during which he was supposed
to have been drowned.</p>

<p>“Really, Squire Dove,” said the Sydney merchant,
“I am so rejoiced to see you once more, together with
your daughter and my son, that as I wish to hear
about their more thrilling adventures, I will make
short work of my own miraculous escape from a
watery grave. So I will briefly mention that, instead
of being washed over the side of the <i>Neptune</i> by a
heavy sea off the Cape of Good Hope, as my brother
and even Captain Link believed, I was, in point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
fact, cast overboard by Falcon and Croft, who were
passengers in the ship, and who expected to get hold
of my will, which I had made greatly in favour of
Falcon. And I may tell you that these wretches were
foiled in rather a curious way, for the steward of the
ship, who was an ingenious man, had invented and
made a cork cap and belt, which he kindly supplied
me with, as I was a great deal on deck owing to an
asthmatic affection, but had no idea, though the
steward had, that my life would be attempted while
on board of my own vessel by a man I had befriended.
However, I had been warned by the
steward not to place much confidence in those two
men, so that I had taken my will and some bank-notes
and placed them inside the steward’s waterproof
life-belt, which I wore then, when I was carried, or,
in fact, hurled overboard at night on our shipping a
very heavy sea, I was providentially not drowned.
Floating, unseen by those on deck, I drifted in the
direction of a vessel, and, being taken on board, was
able to reach Cape Town. Here I was immensely astonished
to find the steward in hospital, and he told
me that, instead of being washed down the companion
ladder by the same wave that carried me over
the ship’s side, he was deliberately wounded by blows
struck by Falcon and Croft. Little did they think
that he would recover after they had gone on to
London in the <i>Neptune</i>, and that I should soon tread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
on their heels and bring back with me a witness
against them in the person of the steward himself.
I had also left a second legacy to Falcon—believing
him at that time to be a true friend—provided he induced
my son Harry to relinquish ballooning and to
seek the hand of a young lady who at the present
moment shall be nameless, though she is not at this
moment a hundred miles away.”</p>

<p>After these incidents had been more fully discussed,
Harry Goodall and the ladies respectively related the
astonishing devices to which Falcon and Croft had for
so long past employed against them all, as are already
known to us.</p>

<p>Captain Ami seems to have fully carried out his
contract made with Harry Goodall and Captain
Link on board the <i>Retriever</i>, and at the same time
was the means of bringing Miss Dove and her companion
under the protective escort of their respective
lovers.</p>

<p>Before the party broke up, the squire announced,
amidst general congratulations, that, ere many
weeks would be over their heads, two weddings
would be solemnised in the village church of
Wedwell, namely that of Mr Harry Goodall with
Miss Dove, and of Captain Link with Miss Chain, and
with full consent of the parties’ respective parents.
And he added that he believed that it was an open
secret that wedding bells would ring in congratulations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
of others known to them, whose loyalty and
bravery entitled them to win hearts true as their own.
All reference to the fates, sad, though richly deserved,
of Falcon and Croft was carefully avoided, so that no
discordant note might tend to mar the harmony of the
gathering.</p>

<p>However, the reader may be interested to know
that Falcon’s fall resulted in incurable paralysis, while
Croft took his own life by deliberately jumping overboard
during a gale of wind, and previous to the
<i>Retriever</i> falling in with the <i>Panther</i>; though the
ship was brought to, and the most careful search was
made, no trace of him was discovered, so there can be
little doubt as to his fate.</p>
